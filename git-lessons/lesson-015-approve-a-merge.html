            <ul>
                <li>Note: The following instructions are specific to the Green-side gitlab.  These instructions also apply to the Red-side gitlab, however the URL is different, so keep that in mind.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>To recap where we are:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In Lesson 6, we cloned the "hello-git" repository</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 7, we made a new branch to do some work in: "addNiceGreeting"</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 8, we made a change to a file in our local copy of the "hello-git" repository</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 10, we "staged" our branch's files for the next step</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 11, we took a snapshot of our branch by using the "git commit" command</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 12, we pushed changes to the origin (Gitlab)</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 13, we checked to make sure the "addNiceGreeting" branch made it to Gitlab</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 14, we requested to merge the "addNiceGreeting" branch into the "master" branch</li>
                    <li>In THIS lesson, we will approve that request...</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <li>Login to your UNET workstation (or Remote UNET, or UVDI, etc.)</li>
                <li>Start the Chrome browser and go to "https://gitlab.fbi.gov"</li>
                <li>Login as necessary</li>
                <li>In the upper left, click on "Projects"</li>
                <li>In the dropdown menu that appears, click "Your projects"</li>
                <li>A list of projects you have access to appears</li>
                <li>Find the project named "Hello Git" and click on it</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>On the left side of the page, there should be an entry saying <kbd>Merge requests &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</kbd></li>
                <li>Click on that <kbd>Merge requests</kbd> entry on the left</li>
                <li>You'll be shown a page listing the merge request you created in Lesson 14</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Click on the title of the merge request --- it should be the last Commit message you entered:</li>
                <ul>
                    <i><b><u>Added a nice greeting to hello-git.html</u></b></i>
                </ul>
                <li>You'll be taken to a page for that merge request</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>There are a few sections on the merge request page:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first section gives you a link where you can view the changes that will happen as a result of the requested merge</li>
                    <li>The second section is for approvals. Those are optional in this case.</li>
                    <li>The third section has the button to execute the merge:  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Merge</button></li>
                </ul>
                <li>That third section is what we are interested in</li>
                <li>About that third section:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The green checkmark in a circle means that the "addNiceGreeting" branch and the "master" branch have no conflicts --- in this case, "addNiceGreeting" will add one line of text which doesn't overlap anything already in the "master" branch</li>
                    <li>The <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Merge</button> button is what we'll click on to tell Gitlab to execute the merge</li>
                    <li>The <kbd>&#9745; Delete source branch</kbd> tells Gitlab to delete the "addNiceGreeting" branch once the merge is complete</li>
                    <ul>
                        <i>(We generally want to delete source branches --- branching should be done for specific additions or fixes, and once we are done with them, the branches shouldn't stick around.  New additions or fixes should then be branched from the new version of "master".)</i>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Go ahead and click on the <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" onclick="alert('Smart alecs...')">Merge</button> button</li>
                <li>The page will update to show that this merge record is completed</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Next time, we'll sync your local repository to match the one now on Gitlab</li>
                <li>DONE!</li>
            </ul>
