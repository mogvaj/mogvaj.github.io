            <ul>
                <li>Note: The following instructions are specific to the Green-side gitlab.  These instructions also apply to the Red-side gitlab, however the URL is different, so keep that in mind.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>To recap where we are:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In Lesson 6, we cloned the "hello-git" repository</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 7, we made a new branch to do some work in: "addNiceGreeting"</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 8, we made a change to a file in our local copy of the "hello-git" repository</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 10, we "staged" our branch's files for the next step</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 11, we took a snapshot of our branch by using the "git commit" command</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 12, we pushed changes to the origin (Gitlab)</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 13, we checked to make sure the "addNiceGreeting" branch made it to Gitlab</li>
                    <li>In THIS lesson, we will request that the "addNiceGreeting" branch be merged into the "master" branch...</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <li>Login to your UNET workstation (or Remote UNET, or UVDI, etc.)</li>
                <li>Start the Chrome browser and go to "https://gitlab.fbi.gov"</li>
                <li>Login as necessary</li>
                <li>In the upper left, click on "Projects"</li>
                <li>In the dropdown menu that appears, click "Your projects"</li>
                <li>A list of projects you have access to appears</li>
                <li>Find the project named "Hello Git" and click on it</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Under the project title, look at the section showing the number of branches belonging to this project:</li>
                <ul>
                    <i>1 Commit - <b>2 Branches</b> - 0 Tags - 72 KB Files - 72 KB Storage</i>
                </ul>
                <li>Click on the heading for "2 Branches"</li>
                <li>You'll come to a page showing a listing of "Active Branches"</li>
                <li>In the entry for the "addNiceGreeting" branch, click on the button labeled "Merge request"</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Next comes a page to enter a "New merge request"</li>
                <li>The first line says:</li>
                <ul>
                    <i>From <kbd>addNiceGreeting</kbd> into <kbd>master</kbd>   <u>Change branches</u></i>
                </ul>
                <li>As it says, you'll be merging the "addNiceGreeting" branch into the "master" branch</li>
                <li>You could change those by clicking on the "Change branches" link...we won't do that today</li>
                <li>The "Title" of this Merge Request defaults to the "memo" submitted with the most recent "commit"</li>
                <li>You can enter a more detailed description of the features/functionality being added from the "addNiceGreeting" branch into the "Description" field (we'll leave it blank this time)</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Next comes a series of fields</li>
                <li>The meanings of these fieldnames have changed over time...but here's a guide:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Assignee</b>: this stands for the person with the most vested interest in this Merge Request --- probably you</li>
                    <li><b>Reviewers</b>: these will be people who will be sent a notification with a link to look over the code changes you have made --- not necessarily "approvers" of the merge</li>
                    <li><b>Milestone</b>: IDK...I've never used it</li>
                    <li><b>Labels</b>: IDK...I've never used it</li>
                    <li><b>Approvals</b>: This one is made up of 2 subfields:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Approvers</b>: People who are authorized to approve this merge</li>
                        <li><b>Approvals required</b>: The number of approvers who must approve the merge</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>Merge options</b>: Another one made up of 2 subfields:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Delete source branch...</b>: in our case, this means that, once the changes from "addNiceGreeting" are merged into "master", then the "addNiceGreeting" branch will be deleted --- MAKE SURE THIS IS CHECKED</li>
                        <li><b>Squash commits</b>: in our case, we only made one snapshot ("commit"). In some cases, a coder might make multiple "commits" in a coding session, then do a final "git push" at the end of the day. The "squash" option will allow you to describe all those commits with a single line of text rather than keeping track of all the others that you don't need to keep track of anymore --- N/A IN OUR CASE</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Finally, at the bottom of the Merge request, there is a blue button labeled <kbd>Create merge request"</kbd></li>
                <li>Click that button!</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Next time, we'll approve that merge request!</li>
                <li>DONE!</li>
            </ul>
