            <ul>
                <li>Note: The following instructions are specific to the Green-side gitlab.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>To recap where we are:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In Lesson 6, we cloned the "hello-git" repository</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 7, we made a new branch to do some work in: "addNiceGreeting"</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 8, we made a change to a file in our local copy of the "hello-git" repository</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 10, we "staged" our branch's files for the next step</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 11, we took a snapshot of our branch by using the "git commit" command</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 12, we pushed changes to the origin (Gitlab)</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 13, we checked to make sure the "addNiceGreeting" branch made it to Gitlab</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 14, we requested to merge the "addNiceGreeting" branch into the "master" branch</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 15, we executed the merge</li>
                    <li>In Lesson 16, we made sure our local repo matched the origin's repo</li>
                    <li>In THIS lesson, we will see what needs to be done to deploy new files...</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Up to now, the Git concepts we've been talking about have been pretty universal. Chances are that users aren't accessing production environment files from the Gitlab server(s), though. Those are probably hosted on a production server better attuned to end-user access. We'll consider a couple different possibilities:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A network file share</li>
                    <li>Sharepoint</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Network File Share</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clone the latest version of the project to your "Development" folder</li>
                    <li>Test the new version for functionality</li>
                    <li>Make a copy of the entire network folder holding the production files as a backup</li>
                    <li>Copy-paste the changed files from your Development folder to the production network folder, over-writing the old versions</li>
                    <li>Set a calendar reminder to yourself to delete the backup folder as necessary</li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <li><h3>Sharepoint</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clone the latest version of the project to your "Development" folder</li>
                    <li>Test the new version for functionality</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>We'll still be copying files from your Development folder to a Sharepoint folder, but we'll have to keep two things in mind:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Sharepoint has limitations on the filetypes it will serve:</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Most notable is the fact that it doesn't serve ".html" filetypes. Those must be renamed to ".aspx" (Thank Microsoft for that)</li>
                            <ul>
                                <i>Also: any references between .html files will need to use the extension .aspx.  Again, thank Microsoft.</i>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Sharepoint is "helpful":</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you overwrite an existing filename, Sharepoint tries to "help" you by renaming the old file, and then finding any references to it in any other files on Sharepoint and changing those references to the renamed old file...because obviously that's what you meant to do. So you'll still end up with the old content.</li>
                            <li>To avoid Sharepoint's "help," first delete the old files, then copy the newer versions into their place</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>DONE!</li>
                <li>There is no more</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
