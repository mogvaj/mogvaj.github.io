<p class=Standard align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><b><span id='Chapter-1'>1</span></b></p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Look!” called out my
wife, Megan from the front passenger seat.  “It’s the Pennsylvania state line! 
Quick everyone, hold your breath!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            This travel tradition
was inherited from Megan’s family.  The “Welcome to Pennsylvania” sign standing
by the side of the interstate marked another state down on our trip toward
Palmyra, New York.  I tapped CTR ring the kids had given me as a birthday present
on the steering wheel anxiously.  Again, I checked the clock on the dashboard
for the umpteenth time and mentally calculated that there were only about six
more hours left of driving till we reached  Palmyra for what I was determined
would be the best, most memorable McCraig family church history vacation of
all-time anywhere, and without the help of <i>him</i>!</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The trip odometer
continued to slowly count the miles since we’d left our driveway early this
morning.  With only a modicum of contention (“That’s my spot!”  “No one has a
spot with their name on it.”  “Don’t put your stuff on top of mine!”  “Not
everyone can have their stuff on top.”  “I’m by the window!”  “We’ll take turns
sitting by the window”), we had settled into a blissful state of unity and harmony. 
Megan was in charge of making sure the harmony didn’t get out of control.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            But, by my latest
calculation, we were still running late.  To start out the best, most memorable
church history vacation ever, we absolutely had to start the trip out right by
staying at the best hotel, closest to all of the church history sites in
Palmyra.  But since this trip had been planned at the last-minute (thanks to a
phone call from a not-so-favorite former mission companion of mine), that hotel
was completely full.  No vacancies.  Nada.  Why?  Because this week marked the
start of the Hill Cumorah Pageant season.  Ergo, no rooms available.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            But, in a stroke of what
I attributed to be divine intervention, the hotel in Palmyra had called late
the previous night saying they’d had a cancellation, and said that we could
have the room for the coming week <i>if</i> we arrived by 4:00 PM today. 
Otherwise, they would go ahead and offer it to the next hopeful person on their
waiting list.  But I had already decided: that room was as good as foreordained
to be ours for the week!  Even if we had to elbow some other nice family out of
the way, it had our name on it.  We were definitely going to make it in time,
because after all, as I alluded to before, this was going to be the greatest Higgs-free
(more on that later) summer spiritual pilgrimage ever taken by a family, and it
had to start perfectly.  And, having awakened all the kids last night and
warned them appropriately, I had moved our departure time up this morning a
generous amount.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            However, there had been
some type of mix up this morning with our youngest daughter Piper and her
luggage.  Piper is our last primary girl, and today she was sporting pig-tails
at odd angles, a bright orange shirt, and sitting way back in our minivan’s very
last row of seats.  The luggage problem had been that Piper’s suitcase, which
had been packed last night, was found empty this morning for some reason (maybe
a mysterious case of sleep-unpacking?).  This had caused us to run a little
late, so now I was rationing our meal times and bathroom breaks in order to
make sure we didn’t end up having to stay at the backup venue for the week: the
Possum Creek Camp Ground, a creatively named mud bog with no running water or
electricity.  The imperfect place to stay would, after all, be the first
mustache on my <i>Mona Lisa </i>of a vacation.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Stealing a look into the
rear-view mirror, I saw that my newly deaconized son, Easton, was winning the
fat cheeks breath-holding contest currently taking place between him, his older
sister Marianna, and Piper.  Easton was starting to grow taller and stronger,
now, which was helpful this morning as he had been a big help to me hefting
everyone’s suitcases out into the back of the van while Piper re-packed her
suitcase as quickly as possible.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I edged the cruise
control speed up a notch as we crossed the state line into Pennsylvania, and
all five participants in the breath-holding tradition (the exception being
Lauren, our oldest daughter) expelled stale, lung-fulls of old, boring Maryland
air and gasped for the fresher and much more exotic Pennsylvania air.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan looked over at the
speedometer and said, “You’re speeding again, Will.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I know, I know,” I
said.  I sighed in frustration and grudgingly let the needle fall back to the
legal speed limit again, glancing at the round shield and red background of my
CTR ring.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You’re not usually like
this, Will.  First you come up with this all-of-a-sudden trip to Palmyra---”
she started.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The Palmyra pageant
only comes once a year,” I defended.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Then you get us all up
in the middle of the night---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The hotel called and
said they had a cancellation and we had to be there by 4:00 PM in order to
claim our room,” I defended again.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Then you were upset
with Piper---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Everyone was supposed
to have packed their suitcase last night, and hers was empty,” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I don’t understand how that
could have happened...I packed it with her last night,” Mindy mused while
looking out the passenger side window.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Beats me.  But it was
empty this morning,” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan turned her
attention back to me.  “Anyway, you aren’t usually this...”  She hesitated.<br>
            “What?” I asked, inwardly wincing from the recognition in her
voice.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It’s almost like you’ve
gotten your annual call from...” she began, but again trailed off.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I turned my head
slightly in her direction with nervous eyes.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “He did call, didn’t
he?” she asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I shrugged
non-committally.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So that’s it.  You’re
letting <i>him</i> get to you, again, aren’t you?” asked Megan, one eyebrow
raised at me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I sighed.  She knew me. 
I would eventually end up blaming this entire trip on <i>him</i>.  After all,
who did he think he was?  He’d called me up out of the blue a few days ago
bragging about how he’d been chosen to be Father Lehi in the Palmyra pageant;
that he’d been thinking of me and my poor family; and that he thought we should
come up to Palmyra where he would give us the best vacation ever by getting us
into the hotel, personally giving us back-stage access to all the sites, and
finally, he’d pull some strings to actually get us into the pageant.  I’d told
him no thanks, hung up, and then decided that no Utah Mormon socialite was
going to outdo me on my own coast.  I’d grown up out here in the East and had
been to Palmyra several times.  I could do this as well as or even better than
him.  I even knew about the ice cream place in Palmyra that was popular with
pageant people.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            But, step one was to get
us into that hotel.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Will, are you sure you
got everything packed for Piper this time?” asked Megan, shaking me out of my
teeth-grinding thoughts.  She was searching for something to feed our children
in the now-empty plastic bags we’d hastily packed with every morsel of junk
food we could find in the house last night (as I said, no time to stop anywhere
along the way).  “We don’t want to end up with another suitcase full of
forty-two pairs of socks again.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yep.  In addition to
socks, she packed underwear, pants, shirts, a toothbrush, and a couple other
things...oh yeah, shoes!” I announced proudly.  “I told her what to pack myself
while I was carrying stuff out to the van with Easton.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan nodded tolerantly,
then tilted her head dramatically to the side and asked, “Did Piper’s bag make
it to the van?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I started to answer,
then caught myself.  I didn’t actually know the answer to that part.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Piper?” I called into
the rear-view mirror again.  I saw Piper still sitting in the back seat, the
one she never ever wanted, but which she had vehemently insisted she sit in
today, back with all the luggage.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What?” she answered
back quickly, her eyes wide open.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Did your suitcase make
it into the van?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Piper’s eyes darted to
the stack of bags beside her, then back to me.  “Yes,” she croaked softly. 
“It’s right here beside me.”  She gently patted the suitcase on top of the
stack.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Is she feeling okay?”
whispered Megan.  “She doesn’t sound right.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I hope so.  She didn’t
act like anything was wrong this morning,” I answered.  “Of course, it was
pretty early, so it was still dark and everyone was sleepy.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “That reminds me,” said
Megan.  “I have to call Jared now that it’s daylight.  I need to make sure he
takes care of the cat today.”  Megan pulled her cell phone out and dialed. 
“Hello, is this Jared?  Hi, Jared.  This is Megan from next-door...  Your
neighbor...”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Jared lived in the house
next-door to us back at home.  He had wavy, cow-licked brown hair, bright brown
eyes, freckles on both cheeks, and new permanent teeth that were still too big
for his face.  He was always at our house, usually eating something from our
refrigerator, like the pumpkin roll made special for me by my mother last
Christmas.  Which I ended up missing out on.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, not the neighbors
in the green house,” Megan went on.  “We live in the yellow house...  No, the
one right beside yours...  Yes!  The one with the cat...  Exactly, that’s why
I’m calling.  You see, we had to leave earlier than we thought, so I wondered
if you could go ahead and start feeding Angel today...  Who’s Angel?  Angel is
our cat’s name, remember?...   Yes, it is a funny name...  No, he’s a boy
cat...  Okay, so you’ll remember to feed him?  Just one scoop per day,
remember?  And change his water, too?  Okay, Jared.  Thank you!  Bye.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Five bucks says we come
home to a dead cat,” said Lauren.  Lauren was going through a...
“dark”...phase.  Her eyes tended to sulk behind thick layers of black
eye-liner, and I hadn’t really seen her express an emotion other than “annoyed”
(is that even an emotion?) for quite a while.  The only thing ever-present with
Lauren anymore was her latest find from the library, usually a thick book about
vampires or wizards, and this seemed to be what she was focusing on today there
in the back seat behind me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I checked Piper in the
rear-view mirror.  As the cat-whisperer in our family, any anti-feline
sentiments were usually taken quite personally by her, so I expected her to
react negatively to Lauren’s comment.  Fortunately, Piper was still calm, so I
concluded that she must not have heard Lauren’s five-dollar wager.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The miles ticked by
through the green hills of Pennsylvania much too slowly for my growing anxiety,
and as we neared the New York border, the kids started to get hungry and
restless, having exhausted all food and whatever handheld games or doodle pads
they’d brought with them.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            In an effort to stem the
rising tide of whining in the back, I tried a diversionary tactic.  “Marianna,”
I said.  “You’re in charge of keeping us all on track this week.  Where’s your
schedule?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Marianna’s face lit up
with glee.  Marianna was the bright ball of happy sunshine in our family. 
Sometimes a little too bright.  She loved learning about everything and loved
even more to tell us all about it.  She rustled through the backpack at her
feet and pulled out a pink and purple notebook with a green, feathery pen
attached to its front.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Monday,” she read from
the first page.  “Drive to Palmyra.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Tuesday, we’ll visit
the Martin Harris Farm in Palmyra, an ice cream place that Dad knows about, and
the Peter Whitmer Farm in Fayette.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wednesday, the E. B.
Grandin Building, where the Book of Mormon was first published, the Sacred
Grove, and the Hill Cumorah.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Thursday, do baptisms
in the Palmyra Temple, and then watch the Hill Cumorah Pageant.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “And Friday, drive
home,” Lauren finished for her.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Didn’t we also list
some things to do in the van?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh yeah,” she said,
flipping the page.  “Piper’s safety briefing, sing the Articles of Faith songs,
the books of the Book of Mormon song, all verses of ‘Follow the Prophet,’ and
spot the first license plate from Utah.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Piper,” said Megan. 
“Can you remind us of the safety rules?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Piper was put onto her
school’s safety patrol last year, and as a result, she had become pretty
insistent on leading anything and everything to do with safety in our family. 
That’s actually putting it mildly.  She was a safety nut!  Recently, she had
run a fire drill at our home with a stopwatch, with all main floor exits
blocked, forcing us all to rappel on bedsheets tied together from a second
story window.  All of this at 2:00 AM in the morning.  When we reached her
waiting in her safety patrol harness and plastic badge at the rallying point,
she’d informed us that we had all just died a painful and fiery death due to
being twenty seconds behind the escape time recommendation of Rufus the fire
station dalmatian.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Um, I dunno,” Piper
started.  “How about look both ways before crossing the street?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Piper’s sudden lack of
enthusiasm for the subject caused all of us to stare in her direction.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay,” said Easton slowly,
intonating the surprise that most of us felt.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I know something we
should remind everyone of,” said Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What?” asked Piper.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “We need to make a new
password,” said Megan, turning in her seat to look back at Piper.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, yeah,” said Piper
gloomily.  One of Piper’s favorite safety rules was that any grown up other
than her parents had to have the family password or she would not go with
them.  Period.  “Is the bishop still mad at me?” she asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, Piper.  He dried out,”
said Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What happened?” asked
Lauren.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “A couple weeks ago,
Piper wouldn’t let the bishop into our house when he came to pick up his church
keys that---”  Here, Megan turned a scolding eye toward our son.  “---Easton
had in his room for some reason.  Unfortunately, it was raining at the time.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Piper was home alone?”
I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No,” said Megan. 
“Lauren was there, but she was upstairs reading with headphones on and didn’t
hear the doorbell.  She missed the whole thing.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Why did Easton have the
bishop’s church keys, anyway?” asked Lauren, clearly trying to stir something
up.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hey, he asked me to go
unlock a door for someone and I forgot to give them back to him,” said Easton,
holding his hands up in surrender.  Absconding with the bishop’s church keys
sounded like a feat Easton might like to pull off if only to prove it could be
done.  Everyone knew that, so he was understandably trying to protect his
honor.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Anyway,” said Megan. 
“We need a new password, now, since we had to give the last one to the bishop.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You mean ‘Fried
Boogers’ is dead?” asked Easton.  “Aw, man!  That was a good one.  I liked it.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Of course you did.  You
came up with it,” said Lauren.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Anyone have a
suggestion?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “‘My underwear’s too
tight!’” Easton replied with a mischievous grin.  He came up with it very
fast.  Too fast.  So I surmised that he had a list already populated with these
types of pass-phrases in his head.  Everyone started laughing.  I started to
disagree but Megan shook her head.  I just hoped I would never need to give it
to anyone.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay, then.  The new
password is now ‘My underwear’s too tight.’  What’s next Marianna?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The Articles of Faith
Songs,” she answered brightly, making a check mark by that entry in her
notebook.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Piper, have you
finished learning all the Articles of Faith in primary, yet?” asked Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Not yet,” answered
Piper.  She jerked her head over toward her packed bag, again.  I thought for a
second she might be about to pull out the scriptures I had instructed her to
pack that morning.  That way, she could find the Articles of Faith and sing
along.  However, something about her jump told me that maybe she might be
hiding something else in her luggage.  I wondered if I were jumping to
conclusions, or whether I really should be suspicious.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’m not singing,” said
Lauren flatly, bringing her book back up in front of her face.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I think I’m too hungry
to sing,” said Easton, his hand dramatically rubbing his stomach.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan reached down under
the passenger-side seat and fished around by her feet again and, this time,
found a small box by her right foot.  It had a few remaining chocolate covered
cake treats left in it.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Sorry, guys, there’s
nothing left, after these,” said Megan, tossing the snacks back to each of our kids.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hey, no interceptions
allowed!” yelled Lauren, the prospect of food rousing her from behind the book.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I wasn’t intercepting. 
I just didn’t want it to fall onto the floor,” yelled Easton from the other
side of the van, with only a little sugar-coated indignity in his voice.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Mine is a little bit
crushed,” said Marianna, peeling off the plastic wrapper carefully so as not to
waste any of the caloric content in her rations.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Do I get one, Mom?”
said Piper’s tiny voice from the back.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I passed four of them
back there.  Where’s the fourth one?” asked Megan, her eyes on Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, here it is!” said
Easton.  In the rear-view mirror I saw Easton suddenly “find” the fourth snack
cake in the seat pocket in front of him.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            While the kids argued
over who had the biggest last meal, Megan turned to me.  “Will, I can’t control
them much longer.  Hunger has taken over.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay everyone,” I said
over the commotion in the back.  “Contest time!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Contest?  What
contest?” asked Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Let’s see who can be
the quietest the longest,” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “That’s so stupid.  It’s
not even worth playing because you don’t actually win anything,” protested
Lauren.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “How about if the winner
gets...” I reached back and pulled my wallet out.  “All the money I have in my
wallet at this very moment?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            My ploy worked.  The
arguing stopped.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “How much is in your
wallet?” asked Marianna, voicing the obvious question.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Now, I knew that I never
carried actual money around with me.  I had converted to using nothing but
plastic years ago.  But in order to push my bluff forward, I shrugged and
answered, “You’ll have to play to see, won’t you?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I smiled and looked over
at Megan, intent on giving her the “I am the master” face.  However, her face
was wide-eyed and countering with an “I put money in your wallet without you
knowing it” face.  My face then, of course, fell.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You put money in my
wallet?” I whispered to her.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “There was a bunch of
money in the glove compartment, so I put it in there so it wouldn’t get lost,”
she whispered back.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “That was for the
tollway in New York!” I whispered back.  “Now we’ll have to go a different
way.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The tollway should take
credit cards, right?” she asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I have no idea,” I
said.  I adjusted the GPS to bypass toll roads.  It put us even more behind schedule.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And with that, all
McCraigs in the van became silent.  However, unbeknownst to <i>most</i> of the
McCraigs in the van, there was yet another family member present who would not
be winning the money my wife had so inconveniently placed in my wallet.  Just as
the quiet game had gotten underway, we suddenly heard a very distinctive sound
from the direction of Piper’s seat:</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “BLEAAAYECGH!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%;page-break-before:always'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><b><span id='Chapter-2'>2</span></b></p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The sound of highway
zipping below us mixed with the drone of the engine was the only thing that
followed the unmistakable sound that had interrupted the onset of the quiet
game.  I knew that sound.  It was an all-too-common sound at our house.  Jared
probably knew that sound, as well, he’d been over at our house so much.  I
hated that sound.  And from the confused looks that I could see in the
rear-view mirror, everyone else knew what that sound was, too.  And, it wasn’t
anything lovely or of good report, or praiseworthy, either.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Um, what was that
sound?” I asked calmly.  Why even ask?  As I said before, everyone already knew
exactly what it was, and what had made the sound.  The only question was, why
was it here in the van with us?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            More of the sound of the
highway interspersed with the ticks of road cracks passing underneath.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Finally, Easton raised
up from his seat and peered into the way-back seat where Piper was sitting,
staring in my direction with wide, unblinking eyes.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Uh-oh,” came Easton’s
voice from below the rim of his seat-back.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What do you mean,
‘uh-oh’?” Megan asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Marianna and Lauren both
decided that anything that elicited an “uh-oh” from Easton was worth, at least
in Lauren’s case, putting down her book and taking a look.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh no!” went Marianna.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Piper, however, remained
motionless and silent.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Who’s idea was this?”
called out Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Who’s idea was what?”
Megan asked again.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Now, honestly, I really
did, as I said, already know what the answer to my earlier question was.  I
knew what that sound had been.  But only the purest optimism in me urged me
onward in my determination to persist in ignorance.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Whose idea was it to
bring the cat!” clarified Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The cat!?!” Megan
exclaimed.  “The cat is supposed to be at home being cat-sat by Jared!  Did it
just throw up?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Sounded like it to me,”
said Marianna.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “<i>Looked</i> like it
to me,” said Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And, at that point, our
cat Angel began meowing loudly from the floor under Piper’s feet.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Well, there it was.  No
more optimism possible on my part.  “Who brought the cat?” I asked as calmly as
I could, even though I was sure who the culprit was.  I was trying to decide
whether it would be worth it to turn around and drive Angel back home from this
point, now having crossed the entire state of Pennsylvania.  It would mean
losing the hotel room and being forced to stay at the Possum Creek Camp Ground,
the land of portable toilets.  I had to concentrate on my CTR ring at that
point.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Piper’s face began to
contort into a sob and she reached down to pick the cat up.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I didn’t want Angel to
feel left out!” she cried.  “He should know about the Church, too, right?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Great.  Wonderful.  How
do you scold a kid for something like that?  I wonder which of the older kids
had advised her to defend herself by giving that answer.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I won!” cried Lauren.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Won what?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The quiet game,” said
Lauren.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I had to take a deep
breath at this point.  I handed Mindy my wallet and looked away so as not to
see how much money I’d just lost.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wow, that’s a lot of
cash,” said Easton as Mindy passed Lauren’s winnings to her.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Cha-ching!  Seventy-five
bucks!” said Lauren, clearly enjoying the mayhem that was just now coming to a
good boil.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Piper!” I spluttered as
I turned on the right blinker for the next exit so I could pull over and assess
the cat damage.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I bet <i>he</i> never
has to worry about cat sick in <i>his</i> vehicle!” I grumbled to myself.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.45pt;line-height:200%'>I slowed the minivan
to a stop on the side of the off-ramp.  Before getting out, I took a deep
breath, checked the clock on the dash again, looked over at Megan and tried to
express with my eyes, “I’m counting to ten, I’m taking a breath, I’m doing my
best to not lose my temper...but back me up!”  Then I stepped out of the van
and went around to open the back gate.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Yep, it was all true. 
There was Piper, holding our gray and white cat Angel, who had just, with
poetic irony, thrown up on my suitcase (who else’s would it have been?).</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I rubbed my forehead
slowly.  One more look at the time.  Would it really be so bad to just take
Angel along?  After all, how much trouble could a single house cat cause on a
vacation to church history sites in Palmyra?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I guess we’ll have to
stop and get some food for him,” I grumbled, reaching up to close the back
gate.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Piper’s eyes suddenly
lit up.  “Oh!  That’s okay, daddy!  I brought food for him!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You did?” I asked,
looking around the pile of wedged-in suitcases for a cat-food container.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I didn’t want you to
have to worry about Angel, so I packed his things in my suitcase,” she
reassured me, trying to restrain Angel as he struggled to escape from her hug.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So, where did you put
your own clothes?” asked Lauren, making a big show of counting ten dollar bills
in her hand.  Apparently, she could guess where this conversation was heading,
and was more than willing to stoke the chaos.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Piper’s face fell.  I
simply closed my eyes.  I suddenly realized why Piper’s suitcase had been
unpacked this morning.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I didn’t have room for
Angel’s food with the clothes still in there, so I took them out,” Piper said,
reaching for the zipper of her suitcase to show me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wait!” I yelled.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I wasn’t fast enough to
stop her.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As if in slow motion, I
watched helplessly as reddish-brown kibble began to pour from the gap Piper had
just unzipped, spilling all over the floor of the van, mixing in with the
previous contents of the cat’s stomach, and out the back onto the ground.  And
as I’d stepped forward in my effort to prevent the spill, I lost my footing and
fell into the mess.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You mean you filled
your whole suitcase with cat food?  After we had repacked it this morning?” I
nearly cried, scraping slimy cat food off my jeans as I stood back up.  I took
another deep breath, squeezed my eyes shut, closed the back gate (it took a few
tries given that cat food had gotten into the frame of the door), and walked
slowly back to the driver’s seat where, thankfully, Megan had a wet towelette
for me to wipe the cat ick off my hands.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Here’s how it’s going
to go,” I said as I wiped.  “Marianna, add this to the schedule.”  Marianna
lowered her green-feathered pen and began scribbling in her book.  “Lauren, you
are going to search on your phone and find out where the nearest Super Big-Mart
is and guide us there.  Megan, make a list.  We need a cat carrier, cat food,
cat litter, a litter box, bowls for the cat’s food and water, and some clothes
for Piper and me.  The rest of you, pick your favorites from the list, because
we’re going to divide and conquer at Super Big-Mart.  We’re running late as it
is, and I don’t want to think of what will happen to that cat if we don’t make
it in time to get our hotel room this evening!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And with that, staring
at four dazed faces (including Angel’s, but not Lauren’s) in the rear-view
mirror, I pealed out from the side of the road, leaving the pile of cat food
I’d slipped in behind us, and sped back onto the Interstate.  Lauren started
lazily swiping her cell phone while Megan arranged who was going to run and get
what when we got to the store.  After about twenty minutes, Lauren guided us
into the parking lot of a store in rural New York where we all (except for
Easton, who would stay in the van with the cat, because as Piper insisted, “We
can’t leave an animal alone in a van!”) bailed out and started running for the
sliding front doors.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Why can’t I stay with
the kitty?” asked Piper.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Because we have to get
some clothes for you,” Megan answered.  She then took out the shopping list and
reminded everyone of their assignments: “Okay, Marianna, you go and get two
pairs of shorts and one pair of long pants for Piper, and three each of socks,
shirts, and underwear.  Got that?”  Marianna nodded quickly.  “Lauren, run and
get some chips, donuts, juices and whatever else looks good since we won’t have
time to stop for anything else till we get there.  Dad and I will go and get
the cat things.  Everyone meet back here in fifteen---”  I cleared my throat in
Megan’s direction in order to remind her that we had to make it to the hotel in
Palmyra on time.  “Er---ten minutes.  Go!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And we were off! 
Marianna raced off in the direction of little girls’ clothing with Piper
stumbling to keep up with her.  Lauren took off toward the junk food.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan and I loaded up
the cart with everything needed to keep a cat alive for a week.  Then, we
knocked a couple of old ladies’ carts out of the way as we escaped from the pet
aisle and barreled our way down the main concourse to our meeting place. 
Lauren showed up with eight varieties of chips, one box of messy powdered
donuts, and two huge jugs of juice.  I guess we hadn’t specified that little
individual juice bottles for everyone would be best---we’d all get to share the
love in the van!</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            After a few more minutes
of finger-tapping, sighing, pacing, and time-checking, Marianna finally ran up
to us, alone, with an armful of Piper-sized clothes, and out of breath.  “Made
it!” she panted.  Though the fact that she had arrived noticeably Piper-less
hadn’t escaped the rest of us, she herself seemed blissfully unaware of this
obvious flaw.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We stood there for a few
seconds, all of us looking at her expectantly as she caught her breath.  Was
she going to fill us in on why she had arrived without Piper?  Or was she
expecting us to guess?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What?” she asked,
finally noticing that we were all looking at her expectantly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            My eyes grew just a
teensy bit wider at this question and Megan quickly rescued the situation.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Marianna, where’s
Piper?” asked Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I thought she was with
you!” said Marianna.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Marianna, how could you
get clothes for Piper without her?  How would you know whether anything fit
her?” asked Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh!  That’s okay, I got
belts!” Marianna announced proudly, holding three belts up.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>             “And why are all the
shirts orange?” asked Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I thought Piper liked
orange.  Anyway, everything should fit,” said Marianna.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “But Piper followed
you!  Where is she?” I finally asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Marianna’s brow furrowed
in concentration and she bit her lip.  “Um, gee, I don’t know.  I didn’t know
she followed me.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Great!” I grumbled,
throwing my stuff into the cart.  “Marianna, if we don’t get to the hotel in
time this evening, no bathroom privileges for you for a week!” I hyperbolized. 
“Everyone, throw your stuff into the cart here.  Watch the clock on the wall up
front.  At the five minute marks, come back here and check in with Mom.  Megan,
stay here with the cart.  Everyone else, split up and start looking for Piper. 
When you find her, bring her back here!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Did you leave the van
unlocked?” asked Megan as Marianna and Lauren took off.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It locks itself about
30 seconds after the last door closes.  Why?” I asked, nervously checking the
clock.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I just wondered if she
would go out to look for us there,” she said.  “Probably not, though.  I think
the safety patroller in her would tell her to find store security.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Nodding, I took off in
the direction I’d seen Piper and Marianna run earlier, all the while thinking
dreadful thoughts of tents, mud, and portable toilets at the Possum Creek Camp
Ground.  I really didn’t want our perfect vacation to be ruined even before it
started.  I looked up and down each aisle I passed, slightly alarming the two
old ladies whose carts we’d barreled through in the pet aisle.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Piper didn’t seem to be
in the cookware section nor the every-size-of-plastic-bin-possible aisle.  She
was likewise not in the fuzzy toilet-seat cover area or the place with all the
cartoon-character bed sheets.  I looked up at the clock and saw that it was
time to head back to the cart.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Anyone else find her,
yet?” I asked as I came up to Megan.  She shook her head no, so I took off in
another direction, one that I’d suddenly thought of---the toys!</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I had to jump over a
pickle spill in aisle thirty-two to get there and dove through the old-lady
dresses to bypass a mob watching an energetic cutlery demonstration.  I really
hoped I wouldn’t run into those two old ladies again.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Within the toy section,
I started at the doll aisle and systematically wound my way through the
building bricks, games, and bikes.  In the middle of the puzzles, the canned
music overhead was suddenly interrupted by a bored teenage boy’s voice: “Will
the parents of a Pepper McGreg please come to the service counter?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The running-water-bathroom
addict in me rejoiced!  Someone had found Piper.  Maybe not one of us, but at
least we knew where she was, now.  I started running toward the service counter
and saw Megan and the other kids coming from the other end at the same time. 
Good!  They’d heard the announcement, too, and they were saving time by not
waiting for me.  I arrived at the service counter first.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “May I help you?” asked
the teenage boy with the bored voice.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I looked around behind
him, but didn’t see Piper.  “Yes, I’m here to get my daughter, Piper.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’m sorry, sir, there’s
no one named Piper here,” he said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I checked the sign over
the desk to make sure I was in the right place.  I was.  “But I just heard an
announcement that said you were looking for the parents of Piper McCraig,” I
said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No...I think it was a
Pepper McGreg,” he said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I had no idea what to
say to that.  I’m glad Megan came up beside me just then.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well, they sound
similar,” said Megan patiently.  “And since we can’t find our daughter, <i>Piper
McCraig</i>, we thought your announcement about <i>Pepper McGreg</i> was
probably our daughter.  See how they sound alike?  Maybe you just heard her
wrong.  Can we see the lost girl you found?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Sorry, Ma’am.  Store
policy.  Can’t let you see the lost girl till you get the right name,” he said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Where is she?” I asked,
losing what little patience I had left, what with the cat, my missing daughter,
and, most importantly, the deadline for the hotel room looming over me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Can’t tell you that,
either, sir.  Safety.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well, can you just go
and ask the lost girl that you <i>do</i> have what her name is and this time
pay very close attention?” I asked slowly, over-annunciating each word.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I can’t leave the
service counter unattended while I’m on duty,” he said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Okay.  This kid was
starting to get on my nerves.  There’s no other way to describe my feelings at
that point: I wanted to grab him by the lapels of his Super Big-Mart smock and
shake him to see if there really was a brain in that head of his.  He was
seriously jeopardizing our hotel room, and by extension, my perfect vacation
plan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Fortunately for him,
Megan came to his rescue again.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What if we told you,”
she began slyly, “that we were the parents of ‘Pepper McGreg?’  We could even
watch the counter for you while you checked.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The boy screwed his eyes
up in concentration, then finally shrugged.  He walked, I could not believe it,
three steps to a door at the end of the counter, opened it and walked in. 
Inside, we could hear a cartoon movie playing, evidently to keep Pepper McGreg
entertained while she waited for her parents to arrive.  The door closed behind
him for a couple seconds.  He came out, closed the door and walked the three
steps back to us and stood there.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Precious seconds ticked
by as he simply stared at me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well?” I prompted.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Did anyone come to the
counter while I was---” he began.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No!  No one came to the
counter in the ten seconds you were gone!  Can we see our daughter?” I
demanded.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The girl says you have
to give me the password first,” he said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            At this I heard two
snorts of quickly stifled laughter from behind me.  I turned slowly and faced
the offenders (Lauren and Marianna), who both immediately buried their heads in
folded arms to pseudo-cease laughing.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I turned slowly back to
the kid behind the counter.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Can I show you her
picture, instead?” I proffered, pulling my phone out.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, sir.  Company
policy says that if there is an established family procedure for identification
of---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “‘My underwear is too
tight!’” I yelled, cutting him off mid-explanation.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Now, I had never before
heard a Super Big-Mart go completely silent in my life.  A constant din is
probably designed and built into the walls.  But, as if a record had scratched
to a sudden halt, there was an absolute silence there in that rural New York
Super Big-Mart that I am confident I will never witness again in my lifetime. 
I peeked behind me and saw the two old ladies I’d plowed through in the pet
aisle staring at me from lane twenty-seven, nodding approvingly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Happens to me all the
time.  Puts me in a foul mood, too,” one of the old ladies said to the other,
finally breaking the silence.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The short version of the
rest of the trip: Piper McCraig was reunited with her family.  We payed for our
stuff (using a credit card as all my cash was now in Lauren’s possession). 
Piper and I changed into the new clothes we’d gotten at Super Big-Mart.  In my
case, I found that the shoes were cheap looking and the pants were, indeed, too
tight, but with no time to spare, I sucked in as much as I could and stuffed
myself in them.  Then, we drove away.  I sped.  I cut corners.  Fortunately,
the GPS had been unable to calculate our arrival time in Palmyra based on
traveling back roads at warp speed, so my testimony that Heavenly Father cares
about me and my bathroom preferences was strengthened as we squealed into the
parking lot of the hotel in Palmyra at 3:57 PM.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wow, look at that huge
yellow Hummer,” I heard Easton say.  I was forced to park behind said Hummer,
as it had been parked diagonally, purposely taking up as much of the entrance
area as possible.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Great!” I growled. 
“This guy’s taken up the whole lane and I can’t get any closer to the front
door!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.45pt;line-height:200%'>I noted the Utah
license plate, but I didn’t have time to think about anything else.  Each tick
of the clock meant only one thing to me now: portable toilets at the Possum
Creek Camp Ground.  If I didn’t get to that check-in counter by 4:00 PM, we
would be cramming into tents and using plastic bathrooms for the next week.  I
was a man on a mission as I bailed out from the van and sprinted for the glass
front doors ahead of the rest of my family.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            With only seconds to
spare, I reached out and grabbed the hotel check-in counter in triumph, checking
the clock on the wall to make absolutely sure.  It was final---we’d made it
there before 4:00 PM.  Hello civilized bathroom!  And then, wonder of wonders,
my eyes fell on another bonus sign: Small Pets Allowed!  Somewhere in the
heavens, a couple of my forebearers in the spirit world were giving each other
high-fives.  Their hands may have passed through each other, but they were, no
doubt, feeling the spirit of the moment.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I chalked our good
fortune up to righteous desires.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “May I help you, sir?”
the girl standing behind the counter asked, her eyes darting nervously over my
shoulder.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes,” I panted,
grabbing at the stitch in my side.  “My name is Will McCraig.  We got a call
about a canceled room last night and reserved it for the---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Four o’clock deadline?”
she asked, her face falling slightly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Exactly!” I answered,
struggling to catch my breath following the all-out sprint from behind the
rudely parked Hummer out in the parking lot.  Behind me, I could hear Megan and
the kids arriving through the front doors.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’m so sorry, Mrs.
Garr,” the girl behind the counter said, looking again over my shoulder.  I
turned to see not only my family coming up to stand beside me, but also a small
group sitting in the waiting area to the left of the front doors.  This group
consisted of two women, one gray-haired who looked to be about sixty, and one
in her thirties, along with a boy and girl of around ten or eleven years old. 
The children were sleeping on the laps of the younger woman, evidently their
mother, and the other was fanning herself with a newspaper.  I hadn’t seen any
of them on my frantic run into the lobby.  “They made it in time, so the room
is taken,” said the girl behind the counter.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The older woman who had
been fanning herself sighed dramatically while the other’s head dropped onto
the back of the seat she was sitting on.  “That’s alright,” said the older
woman.  “We’ll just gather up and head out to see where else we can find.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “How long have they been
waiting?” Megan asked to me as she arrived at my side, a little too loudly, I
thought.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Before I could open my
mouth to answer or even shake my head as a warning to Megan to be quiet, the
girl behind the check-in counter whispered back, “They drove in about eight
o’clock this morning.  All the way from Arkansas.  They said this was their
dream trip.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “And they didn’t make a
reservation first?” I wondered out loud.  Megan elbowed me, exacerbating the
pain of the stitch.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You’re sure you don’t
have any other cancellations?” asked the older woman with the newspaper fan.  I
could hear the children starting to complain as the younger woman began to wake
them in preparation for their departure.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, ma’am, I’m so
sorry.  You might be able to find something in Rochester, though,” said the
girl behind the desk.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, well.  Thank you,
I’m sure we’ll find something,” sighed the older woman.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I pulled my credit card
out and laid it on the counter to make sure that the sweet smell of a sanitary
bathroom was soon to be a part of my evening.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hey Dad, I have an
idea,” came Marianna’s overly loud voice.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Against my better
judgment, I turned around, a look of expectant pain on my face, to hear what
Marianna was going to say.  I noticed that the woman with the newspaper fan had
paused in her preparations to leave in order to hear Marianna’s idea, as well. 
Suddenly, my stomach started to churn in a funny sort of way.  I had a feeling
that I knew the dangerous direction Marianna’s idea was turning this situation
in, and it wasn’t in the direction of modern plumbing.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What’s that Marianna? 
Did you want to start carrying our bags into the lobby?” I prompted.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Funny, Dad,” Lauren
deadpanned.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Maybe we should
huddle,” suggested Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “About what?” I asked,
my eye starting to twitch slightly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Dad!  This is just like
being chased by an elephant!” Piper whispered up at me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan smirked at me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Come again?” I asked
Piper.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You know, in the
Thirteenth Article of Faith.  My primary teacher said that ‘Chased by an
elephant’ means you do nice things for other people,” Piper answered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You mean, ‘chaste’ and
‘benevolent,’” I said.  “There’s no chasing or elephants involved.”  I was
hoping to sway the conversation in a safer direction.  The eyes of the Arkansas
group behind us were now solidly focused on us.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, Dad.  We can follow
your CTR ring and make someone feel loved!” Piper answered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Great.  I had a van-full
of cat vomit to clean up.  My own clothes needed to be washed because of said
cat vomit.  I was tired and my feet hurt in my cheap-o shoes.  I wasn’t looking
forward to setting up a tent in the Possum Creek Camp Ground and using
porta-potties for the whole week.  Most of all, I wanted to do this on my own
--- not with <i>his</i> help.  And <i>now</i> my kids seemed to want to learn
about and practice Christ-like charitable love.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As I stood there keenly
sensing my hopes for an air-conditioned hotel room with hot and cold running
water swirling down the drain, I heard Megan clear her throat, “Ahem!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Suddenly, all eyes in
the lobby were definitely on me, from the girl at the check-in counter, to my
kids and Megan, to the Arkansas group behind me---even their little kids. 
Everyone was suddenly staring at me, waiting for me to say something.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I’d like to say that I
smiled and cheerfully told the check-in girl to put our room in the Garrs’ name
for the week and then offered to carry their luggage in.  I’d love to be able
to claim Good Samaritan status and say that I checked on them from time to time
throughout the week.  I’d love to say that we ended up becoming fast friends
and exchanged Christmas cards for decades afterwards.  As it happened, though,
all I really wanted to do was be selfish and take the room for myself.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            However, I felt like I
couldn’t act that way…at least, not in front of my kids.  Reluctantly, I
reached out slowly and slid my credit card back up off the check-in counter.  I
shrugged my shoulders at Megan as I turned and walked slowly over to the older
woman, whom the girl behind the counter had called Mrs. Garr.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Mrs. Garr, right?” I asked
softly, knowing that everyone was listening to me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes,” she answered
loudly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I understand you drove
a long way to get here,” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes, sir.  Eighteen
hours.  Drove all through the night to get here,” she answered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “And this is your
family?” I asked, indicating the other woman and her two children.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “That’s right.  My
daughter and her two kids, my precious grand babies.”  She smiled widely down
at the two kids.  “And is that your family, too?” she asked, pointing at Megan
and the kids behind me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah, that’s them,” I
muttered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, your littlest
daughter has such a <i>lovely</i> orange shirt,” gushed Mrs. Garr.  “You know,
we have an orange tree in our back yard down in Arkansas.  I just love the
color orange.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Thanks,” said Piper,
doing a little pirouette for her.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I strained in another
lungful of air to keep up my small talk.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So...you all came up to
see the Hill Cumorah Pageant?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, yes!  We just
joined the Church last year and my missionary, Elder Tygart?  Well, he’s here
and he’s in the pageant, and guess what part he’s playing?  The Savior!  I hear
that it looks just like the real thing when he comes down from heaven.  I can’t
wait to see that!  He called us and invited us up special to see him.  I just
can’t wait!  My whole family here wouldn’t know about the Plan of Salvation if
it wasn’t for Elder Tygart!  By the way, that’s an interesting ‘Choose the Right’
ring.  The ones I always see have a green shield shaped background.  Is yours a
knock-off or something?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, I don’t think so,”
I answered, running my fingers through my hair to hide it from view.  “I
understand you need a...” I began, dreading the rest of the sentence too much
to finish.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I took one more look
back at my family.  They all stood there staring at me.  Piper nodded quickly
with her kindergarten smile.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “...a hotel room,” I
finally continued, turning back to Sister Garr.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes, sir, we do.  You
see, we had a room all reserved and waiting for us at another hotel, but when
we got here this morning, after driving all night for eighteen hours, it turned
out that that other place had oversold, and now we’re here and don’t have any
place left to go...except for that horrible looking Possum Creek Camp Ground,
if you want to count that.  You know what?  They don’t even have running water
there!  Only portable toilets!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah,” I said, reaching
up to scratch the back of my head and glancing again at Megan, who shrugged
back at me, “I’ve heard that.  How long are you all staying?”  I plead in my
own head, “Please say <i>just one night</i>!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, we’ll be here for
the whole week!  Elder Tygart’s going to show us around the town!” said Sister
Garr.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You don’t say?”  Well,
that was the end of that last bit of hope.  Sister Garr kept looking up at me. 
“So,” I went on, “We were wondering if maybe you’d like to go ahead and...,” I
took one last deep breath, “...possibly take our room here in this hotel for the
week.  Is that something you all would like to do?  Because if you wanted to
look for something better in Rochester....”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Ugh!  I’d done it.  Now,
the only fragment of hope I had left was that she would say they wanted to make
the hour drive each way to and from Rochester every day this week.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, Hallelujah!” she
cried, clapping her hands together on either side of my face, pulling me
forward into a thank-you kiss.  This elicited more snorts from my kids in the
background.  (I’m pretty sure Megan was laughing, too, but she denied it.) 
“You hear that kids!  We have a place to stay!  Get up kids!  Come and give
this man a hug!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Whoa!  You don’t need
to---”  I was silenced by the force of impact from the two kids running over
and tackling me, knocking me sideways onto the hard lobby floor.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Thank you, so much,
sir!” cried Sister Garr, bent over sideways to see me straight.  “C’mon,
everyone, let’s get checked in!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The Garrs physically
ploughed us out of their path on their way up to the check-in counter.  We
McCraigs all backed away slowly and watched them sign the paperwork and head
over to the elevator doors on the other side of the lobby.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You did a wonderful
thing, Will,” whispered Megan, grabbing my hand and squeezing.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You realize your toilet
tonight will have springs on the door and blue...well, maybe blue...liquid down
in the hole, right?” I whispered back, unwilling to accept this as something
I’d done voluntarily.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Things will work out. 
We’ll get a blessing out of this somehow!” she answered back.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I was just about ready
to herd everyone out to the van as the elevator doors slid open for Sister Garr
and her family.  They pushed their way in and another family popped out into
the lobby, a <i>perfect </i>family, one of those families with quintessential
hair and flawless complexions oozing prosperity.  If Arnold Friberg were to
paint a muscley portrait of the perfect Utah Latter-day Saint family, it would
be this family.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Whenever I have imagined
in quiet moments meeting past girlfriends, childhood bullies, or, as in this
case, past irritating mission companions, I have always pictured myself with
well-coifed hair, great smelling pits, designer clothes, and an expensive
watch.  By now, my hair (what was left of it) was beginning to stick up of its
own accord; I smelled, as I’ve already mentioned, like cat vomit; and, as if
some avenging angel were making the password I’d yelled out back at the Super
Big-Mart store a veritable truth, my Super Big-Mart ill-fitting jeans were
painfully conspicuous to me as I watched this attractive family emerge from the
elevator.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The dad and his
immaculately groomed son immediately smiled at the Garrs and made, I thought, a
huge show of bending down to help Sister Garr lift her huge fluorescent pink
vinyl suitcase into the elevator while his too-blonde wife stood back on
too-high heels and watched.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I didn’t think this day
could get any worse,” I mumbled to Megan, a sick feeling returning to my
stomach.</p>

Hyrum LeGrand Higgins (or “Higgs” as he liked to be called, for short) as the
elevator doors closed on the smiling Garrs behind him.  Of all the people that
I did <i>not</i> want to run into this afternoon, why did I have to cross paths
with Elder Higgins?  And not only that, but now that he’d seen me, he knew that
I’d come to Palmyra after all.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Is that <i>him</i>?”
asked Megan in an interested undertone, her hand resting lightly on my
shoulder.  “The one you always talk about with so much affection?”  And by
“affection,” she meant “non-affection.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I nodded slightly and
then half-heartedly raised my hand to wave at Elder Higgins.  (Suddenly feeling
a little self-conscious about my maybe-knock-off CTR ring, I lowered it
quickly.)  I had not, by determined design, seen Elder Higgins since the
departure interview he’d given me (or roped me into) as the Assistant to the
President in our mission twenty years earlier, the one in which he’d promised
to keep tabs on me over the years.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And now, Higgs was a
thing to behold.  The years since our mission had not only been good to him,
but had obviously bent over backwards and asked, “How can we help you, Higgs?” 
<i>He </i>had a great watch.  <i>His</i> khakis and layered shirts looked like
they just flew in from London, Paris and Milan.  I’m sure any CTR ring he was
wearing was 14 karat gold and definitely NOT a knock-off.  I wasn’t sure if I
was imagining it or not, but I was sure I could smell some tropical rain-forest
type of cologne, something with a name like “Rio.”  And to literally top it all
off, <i>his </i>hair had followed the injunction to multiply and replenish,
with that lazy off-to-the-side look that you get from hanging around a golf
course two afternoons a week instead of working like the rest of us.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Who is <i>that</i>?” I
heard Piper ask one of the other kids in the background.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I think it’s that guy
from Dad’s mission Mom told us about,” whispered Marianna loudly enough for the
Saints down in Arkansas to hear her.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs’ compellingly blue
eyes lit up at this.  “So you’ve told the old fam’ all about our missionary
glory days, eh?  Is this your family, Bro?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I took a deep breath and
began to point distractedly.  “Higgs, this is my wife, Megan.  The crypt-keeper
there is Lauren, the one bouncing on her heels is Marianna, Easton is the boy,
and Piper is the one staring at your shoes.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Like, are those
Guccis?” Piper goggled.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs chuckled and
turned to his wife.  “Honey, this is Elder McGreg, one of my companions from my
mission out in California.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, you must be the
neurologist,” said Higgs’ wife, offering her hand.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, honey, not---” said
Higgs.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, then the lawyer
from Savannah?  I thought I detected a little accent,” she continued with a
smile and a wink.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Raylene, he’s the---”
Higgs tried to interrupt.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Theater producer from
Manhattan?” his wife suggested again.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Geesh!  Did all of
Higgs’ other companions end up doing something cool, except for me?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Raylene, darling, this
is Elder McGreg, my first companion---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “His trainer,” I added
spitefully.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah, he’s the one who
taught me everything I know about the Kamspoozi language,” said Higgs.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Kamsplazi,” I
corrected.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I had to turn my head
slightly so he wouldn’t see me rolling my eyes.  The phrase “everything I know
about the Kamsplazi,” or, in his case, “the <i>Kamspoozi</i> language,” coming
from Higgs, was a very small body of knowledge.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, you mean that poor
computer guy you’ve been trying to fellowship all these years?” Raylene
straightened up and pulled her hand back slightly from me.  The girl behind the
check-in counter stifled a quick laugh of her own.  Fortunately, the phone on
the counter rang right at that moment, so she had to busy herself answering it.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Pleased to meet you,
too,” I said as Megan grabbed my hanging hand out of thin air.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Is this your son?”
Megan asked, trying once again to lead us away from my danger zone.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes!” said Higgs with
one of his overly bright smiles, full of perfect, unfairly white teeth that I
always felt I needed sunglasses for.  “This,” he began, placing his hand on the
boy’s shoulder, “is Hyrum LeGrand Higgins, Junior.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs, Jr. smiled
unctuously down at my kids.  “T’sup?” he articulated.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Higgs, I...uh...,” I
said, but was suddenly drowned out by a blaring radio from behind the counter.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Bob, maintenance check
in room 214,” said the voice from the radio.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I thought you said you
couldn’t come join us here in Palmyra?” Higgs said, pointing out the fact that
he’d recognized we were here after all.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “When would you have
said that?” Megan asked me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan was unaware that
Higgs had called me a few days ago.  I’d conveniently forgotten to tell her
about it.  </p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And here we were.  In
Palmyra.  Just a few days later.  Meeting each other in person after twenty
years.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs started explaining
to Megan: “I called Will a couple weeks ago and told him all about this.  We’re
in the pageant!” Higgs exclaimed.  “I’m playing Father Lehi this year!  Didn’t
he tell you?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I smiled slightly. 
“Must’ve forgotten to tell you.”  I fidgeted for a moment, trying to remember
the “Five Great Ways to End a Conversation” I’d once read about.  “Gosh, Higgs,
it’s, uh, great to see you and everything, but we’ve, uh, got to get going so
we can go find a place to stay this week.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You mean you didn’t
make arrangements before you got here?” Raylene gasped, her botoxed brow
not-creased with fake worry.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Actually, we did,
Barbi---” Lauren began as Megan covered her mouth before the entire trademarked
name escaped her lips.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Bar...Bar...Barbecue
something right before we left...” Megan smiled.  Well, at least it was a try. 
Higgs, Jr. cocked his head to the side and squinted slightly at Lauren in awe. 
I made a mental note to slip another twenty dollar bill into Lauren’s purse
some time soon.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Dad just gave away our
hotel room,” announced Marianna.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You what?” asked Higgs.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I heaved a sigh and was
about to interrupt this part of the conversation when Piper took over.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “That family you passed
getting out of the elevator?  They drove all the way from Arkansas and didn’t
have a room, so Dad said they could have ours.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs looked from Piper
to me and then back to Piper.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hold on a second. 
Jill?” he called over to the girl behind the check-in counter.  A man who was
apparently Bob, according to the cursive name on his overalls, the bottoms of
his pants soaked dark with...something, had just responded to the radio call
we’d heard a few moments prior with a rolling yellow bucket and a giant mop.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Who knows the hotel
staff by name?” I mumbled to Megan as she let go of Lauren’s mouth.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes, Dr. Higgins?” Jill
responded.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “And what hotel desk
clerk knows each guest by name?” asked Lauren.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Are there any rooms
left?” Higgs asked Jill.  Personally, I thought this was sort of preposterous,
as if I hadn’t already thought to ask the same question.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, sir, Dr. Higgins. 
This family just gave theirs to another family.  I think you met them at the
elevator.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs turned back to
me.  I turned to watch Bob rolling his bucket and mop over to the elevator
where Jill was pointing.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Someone must have had a
flood,” said Easton under his breath, evidently watching Bob with the bucket
and mop.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I was suddenly aware of
the ticking of a clock somewhere.  Or maybe it was my pulse pounding in my
ears.  I wasn’t sure.  I could see Higgs’ son still staring at Lauren, which
was understandable: he’d probably never seen anything quite so menacing in his
life.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “‘Tcha readin’?” I heard
Higgs, Jr. ask Lauren, pointing at her book.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “‘How to Avoid Preppy
Twerps,’” Lauren quipped without looking at him.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Returning to the
situation at hand, all I knew was that I didn’t want my old mission companion,
Elder Higgins, the doctor, as it turned out, who couldn’t even pronounce my
name correctly, to be able to take any credit for this vacation.  I wanted the
perfection of this vacation to be all mine.  And, well, for my family, too. 
That goes without saying, though, right?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Huh,” mused Higgs after
rubbing his chin for a few seconds.  Tick tick tick.  “Jill, can you do
something for me?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes, Dr. Higgins,” said
Jill.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Put our room in the
McGregs’ name.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Fifteen minutes later,
Higgses Sr. and Jr. helped all of us McCraigs drag our cat-vomit stained
luggage past the Higgins’ brand new, rudely parked yellow Hummer and into the
hotel lobby.  There, we picked up key cards from Jill and waited for Bob to
take the elevator ahead of us, this time with a wet-dry vacuum along with some
type of industrial strength plunger slung over his shoulder.  Then we rode up
to the top floor of the hotel, where we exited and found room 301.  It had the
one word I’d known would be there in fancy gold lettering above a set of ornate
double doors: SUITE.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Where will you stay?”
Megan asked as Raylene opened the doors, bathing us all in bright, golden light
streaming from inside.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wow!  It’s like the
waiting room for the Celestial Kingdom,” Easton said to Marianna in an
undertone.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Raylene waved her French
tips at Megan.  “Oh, don’t worry about us.  We’ve got a trailer set up in
Zion’s Camp over by the hill that we use during the daytime.  We’ll just sleep
there during the pageant.  We had talked about doing that anyway.  The big car
uses way too much gas---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You think?” came
Lauren’s voice from inside the suite.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “---so we should just
stay over there anyway,” Raylene finished.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Higgs...,” I began
again.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Nope!  Don’t say a
word, Bro.  I owe you big time for all the help with that language!”  Great. 
Guilt trip again: I shudder to think what things he ended up saying to
Kamsplazi people once he became a senior companion.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Do you need us to help
you carry your things down to your car?” Megan asked Raylene.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, don’t worry, we
don’t have all that much,” Raylene said, one long-nailed hand over her heart,
the other pointing at a stack of luggage the size of Mt. Kilimanjaro.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Twenty minutes later,
Easton and I returned from lugging the Higgins’ luggage down to the Hummer, to
the room where the Higginses were bidding the rest of my family good-bye after
their twenty-minute mingle.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Thank you so much,”
gushed Megan to Raylene.  “And you, too, Higgs!” she croaked, nearly in tears
as she gave a quick hug to Higgs, Sr.  “If it weren’t for you, I don’t know
what we would have done.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The trouble is, on the
one hand, I knew Megan was right.  Higgs was, and it pained me to admit this, a
pretty okay guy.  On the other hand, everyone pandered to him just because of
his famous last name.  Even our mission president had been giddy with
anticipation when he’d told me to expect Elder Higgins as soon as he arrived
from the Missionary Training Center.  “The Higginses are good, pioneer stock. 
A prominent family in Salt Lake City.  Having one of them in the Kamsplazi
program is sure to be a huge blessing to you,” he’d gushed.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            However, I had been
Higgs’ companion.  I knew from first-hand experience that he was as flawed as
the rest of us mere mortals.  But time after time, I saw him get breaks,
opportunities, and callings that I missed out on, and I attributed that solely
to the fact that he had the name Higgins, and I didn’t.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            This time, I wanted to
be solely and completely responsible for this perfect vacation.  And I wanted
him to know it, and especially: that I had made this happen without the benefit
of a famous last name.  And now, here at the outset, my plan was being
undermined by Higgs’ offer of that hotel room to us for the week.  The only way
I could rationalize accepting it was that, technically, I’d had our own room
for a glorious three minutes and had magnanimously given it away to someone who
needed it, thus qualifying me, or us, for an even better mansion above (i.e,
Higg’s suite on high).  That made sense.  Right?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The Higginses left us. 
Higgs, Jr. nodded slightly in Lauren’s direction before turning to follow his
parents back toward the elevator.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wow.  Have you seen the
bathroom?  It’s so fancy it’s got a water fountain right beside the toilet!”
said Piper.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Will, can you get our
things unpacked?  I need to call Jared and tell him the cat is with us,” Megan
said, taking out her phone and dialing.  “Hello, Jared?  This is Megan,
again....  No, Megan, not Cindy....  Your neighbor....  Easton’s mom....  Yes,
that’s right.  The yellow house.  You were going to feed our kitty for us while
we were on vacation, remember?....  You already fed him today?  That’s okay.  I
just wanted to tell you that Angel is with us, so you don’t have to feed the
kitty this week....  No, Angel will be with us the whole time....”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As Megan talked on the
phone with Jared, I went over to the oversized windows that stretched across
the back of the master bedroom suite and opened the curtains to let in light
from the sun, which was now ducking lower in the west.  As it happened, Moroni
happened to be there.  Not the <i>real</i> Moroni, but the gold-plated one on
top of the Palmyra temple.  It was glinting there in the sun about on eye-level
with our room, his trumpet pointing roughly in our direction.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “...No, we can’t mail
the kitty to you....  I don’t know if those neighbors have a kitty....  You
would have to ask them if you could feed their kitty....  Right....  No, our
kitty won’t need water, either.  Remember, he’s with us....  Are you sure you
understand?...  Okay, bye.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Do you think he really
understood?” I asked, turning away from the dramatic scene outside the window.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I guess if we find a
huge pile of cat food where Angel’s bowl used to be, we’ll know why.”  Megan
then turned her attention out from the master bedroom to the kids, who were
looking at the TV remote in the sunken floor living room area just off the
entrance dais of the hotel room.  “Hey, why don’t you guys go down to the
pool?” she suggested.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Marianna, Easton and
Piper raced off to the other bedrooms to find their bathing suits, leaving
Lauren alone to retrieve the remote.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Lauren,” I called,
“Aren’t you going to go with the rest of the kids?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Why should I?” she
asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Maybe it’ll wash some
of the eyelin---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “They probably have a
jacuzzi,” interrupted Megan.  “You can sit in the warm water and read your
book.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Lauren fidgeted with the
remote for a couple seconds, then, looked up and <i>looked at us </i>for what
seemed like the first time since she was baptized.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What exactly does it
mean if someone tells you that you’ve got spunk?” she asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%;page-break-before:always'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><b><span id='Chapter-4'>4</span></b></p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wha?” I mumbled, having
just awakened from a very vivid nightmare.  Clawing my way back out from
underneath the sweat-dampened, 1200-thread-count sheet, I looked around the
room.  The lines and angles just visible in the orange light peeking through
the window curtains were as unfamiliar as the shadows on the ceiling.  As I
looked around, I realized I didn’t recognize any of the picture frames along
the walls, either.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Higgs’ room,” I grumbled,
finally realizing where I was.  I tossed the sheet aside and rolled into a
sitting position on the side of the bed.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What’s wrong?” Megan
whispered from some other zip code of the bed.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Nothing.  I just had a
bad dream, that’s all.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Apparently.  You were
thrashing around and almost yelling in your sleep,” said Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What did I say?” I
asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You kept saying, ‘Oh no
you won’t!’ and ‘Where’s a gun when I need one?’  What was that dream about,
anyway?” she asked with a yawn.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I don’t remember,” I
lied.  It’s perfectly okay to lie about dreams.  They aren’t real life, so they
don’t count in temple recommend interviews.  Right?  “Sorry, I didn’t mean to
keep you up.  I’m going to get a drink.”  I got up and felt my way into the
bathroom, closed the door and my eyes, then turned the lights on.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            It had been one of those
dreams, the kind that make you grab your bed covers and sling them over your
head, a truly terrible dream.  It was a hyperventilation-inducing, feverish
sweat producing dream.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            After a moment or so
standing by the light switch, I squinted one of my eyes open wide enough to
find the linen-wrapped glass by the sink.  I unwrapped it, held it under the
spigot, and turned the handle for the cold water.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Nothing came out.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Huh?” I grunted.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I tried the hot water
handle.  Still nothing.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I walked over to the tub
and tried the hot and cold taps there.  Both dry as my bank account compared to
Higgs’, no doubt.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I cracked the door open
and tip-toed over to the phone sitting on my bedside table.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Something wrong, Will?”
Megan asked, sitting up in the light from the bathroom.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The water’s not
working.  What time is it?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan looked at the
clock on her side.  “Two-thirty.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “If they can get it
fixed now, maybe there will be enough time to make sure we have hot water for
tomorrow morning.”  Megan nodded and I picked up the phone and dialed zero.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Front desk.  How may I
help you Dr. Higgins?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hi.  It’s Will
McCraig,” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Are you the guests of
the Higgins family, sir?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes,” I forced through
my gritted teeth.  “But right now, I’m calling about the water.  It doesn’t
seem to be working.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Let me check on that
for you, sir.  I’ll be right back.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            He put me on hold and a smooth
jazz radio station began to play.  It was a little loud, so I held the receiver
out from my ear an inch or two.  I shook my still-groggy head again and
yawned.  I still couldn’t get the nightmare out of my thoughts.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            It had started out as a
great dream.  Lauren was standing in front of me, her hair back to its former
sandy-blonde color, sparkling in a sunny breeze.  “Dad!” she said with a
heart-warming smile.  “I need to ask you something.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What is it?” I had
asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “How did you know that
you wanted to marry Mom?  How did you know that she was the one?” the dream-Lauren
had asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I remembered smiling in
my dream.  “I don’t know.  All I know is that on our first date, I had this
sense that there was something different and special about Megan, but I didn’t
know why---I hardly knew her, after all.  But after a few more dates, it hit
me: she’s the one!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Lauren had smiled and
looked down at her toes.  We were standing in soft, green grass.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Dad, I think that’s
happened to me!” she’d said, smiling and biting her bottom lip nervously.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Really?” I’d said,
smiling in anticipation.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes!  Would you like to
meet him?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Of course, Lauren! 
Where is he?”  I was looking around the meadow we had been standing in, trying
to see if this lucky guy was standing somewhere out in the grass.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Lauren looked back up at
me and smiled.  It was so nice to see her smile again.  Then she stepped
gracefully to her left, revealing the scariest thing I’d ever seen in my life:
Higgs’ bratty son, Higgs, Jr.!  “And the best thing is that he’s a Higgins,”
the dream-Lauren had exclaimed.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes, sir,” came the
tinny voice from the phone, jerking me back from my nightmarish reverie.  The
receiver spun out of my hands and I nearly dropped it.  “There was a major
water line break in one of the other rooms several hours ago.  Our maintenance
personnel are just about finished with repairs and the water should be turned
back on in about an hour.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So we’ll have hot water
tomorrow?” I asked, a little more hope in my voice.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes, sir.  They’ve all
been working overtime since this is for a Higgins.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><b><span id='Chapter-5'>5</span></b></p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!” I
repeated maniacally from the shower.  The water, as promised to Dr. Higgins
last night, had indeed been turned back on.  Apparently, the hotel staff must
have thought that Higginses like their water served soft---<i>very</i> soft. 
The hardness of the water was so wimpy soft that, even in the highest flow
available from the measly fifty pattern shower head in the master bedroom’s
tiny, five-room en-suite bathroom, the shampoo simply yawned and meandered its
way around, resulting in an excruciating chemical burn in my left eye.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What is it?” Megan
asked from some other room beyond the shower curtain.  “Is the water too hot?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, the temperature is
fine.  I’ve got shampoo in my eye and it won’t rinse out!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Then put your eyes in
the water stream,” she suggested in a tone reminiscent of Lauren saying, “Duh!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I have, but the water
is so soft it won’t rinse it out.  It just seems to make it burn even worse!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I know.  I can’t seem
to get the toothpaste off my teeth, either,” she lamented.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Ten minutes later, I
joined the rest of the family sitting at the table in the under-sized formal
dining area of the hotel suite.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Why are you winking at
me?” Easton asked me.  He was sitting directly across from me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’m not,” I said.  “I got
some shampoo in my eye, so it’s just irritated.  It’ll settle down in a little
while.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well, could you just
look at Mom until it settles down, then?” he said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan, as it turns out,
was still licking her teeth under her gums.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So,” I said, changing
the subject, looking around at the Higgins’ breakfast spread that had arrived
promptly at 8:00 AM.  It wasn’t much really.  Kind of lame, actually.  It only
took four guys in white jackets and chef hats three trips to wheel it all in. 
Just eggs, bacon, toast, four types of jam, sausage, hash browns, bagels,
orange and apple juice, some gross looking muffins with big juicy raisins baked
into them, along with some other stuff that didn’t really look all that
appetizing.  I reached for the cereal and milk.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Ooh!  Dad, if there’s a
prize in the box, can I have it?” Piper asked excitedly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I shook the too-full box
and looked in the top.  “Sorry, Piper. This looks like healthy cereal.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “All the more reason
there should be a prize,” Easton remarked while spearing a piece of sausage
from the heaping platter beside him.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Let’s see, Marianna, do
you have your book?  Remind us: where are we going today?” I asked, pouring the
milk from a spotless, silver decanter.  It was probably chalk-watery skim milk,
knowing my luck.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Marianna gagged down
whatever disgusting thing she’d been chewing and wiped her mouth with one of
the tacky linen napkins that were laid around the too-big table all rolled up
in silver rings.  “Wow!  Those are good muffins!” she said, reaching into her
pocket.  She pulled out her pink and purple notebook and opened it.  “First,
we’ll go to the Martin Harris Farm and take the tour there.  Next, we’ll go
have lunch and ice cream at the famous ice cream place Dad knows about in
Palmyra.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Is that the historic
ice cream place that Joseph Smith went to right after the First Vision?” asked
Lauren.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Very funny!” Marianna
retorted.  Hey, at least Lauren knew about the First Vision, though, right?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Sounds good.  Where
else?” I prompted.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The last thing I have
on the list for today was the Peter Whitmer Farm, where the Church was first
organized.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Will, do you know where
these places are?” Megan asked, spreading some of the indecently decadent grape
jelly onto a piece of inch thick wheat toast.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Not exactly.  I was
never a driver when our youth groups visited.  But I figure we can ask the
front desk.”  I punctuated that brilliant idea with a bite of cold cereal.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “They might not know
anything about our church,” Megan suggested.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Mom!” Lauren exclaimed,
obviously glad to take a break from choking down the steaming pile of scrambled
eggs on her plate.  “They have paintings from the Book of Mormon in the
hallways.  They play Mormon Tabernacle Choir music in the elevator.  There is a
stack of hymnals. On the piano. In the  hotel chapel!  I think they’ll have an
idea where these places are.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “How do you know all
that?” Megan asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “We saw them on the way
down to the pool last night,” said Marianna.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            While the four chefs
cleared out the breakfast and Megan got the kids ready to go, I headed down to
the lobby to get directions from Jill.  It turned out that Jill wasn’t at the
check-in desk in the lobby today.  It was some other girl with blue hair, her
mouth full of gum, wearing a name tag that said, “Lisa.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hi,” I said as I
arrived at the counter.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            She looked at me with a
strange look, then made a big act of winking at me.  “Hi yourself.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What?  Oh,” I said,
suddenly realizing what was happening.  I instinctively brought the palm of my
hand up to my left eye to soothe the itching and cover any winking I might be
doing by accident.  “That’s something else I wanted to ask about.  Have the
water problems been completely fixed?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What water problems?”
Lisa managed to get out around the wad of gum she was chomping.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The water problems that
I called about this morning.  The guy I talked to at 2:30 AM said there was a
water pipe broken in another room somewhere, and that’s why the water was off
in our room last night---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wait!” exclaimed Lisa. 
She then swallowed the enormous ball of gum in her mouth. “What were you doing
up at 2:30 in the morning?” Lisa asked, a look of utter shock on her face.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Frankly, I wasn’t sure
how to approach this.  First of all, why would the hotel staff ask what I was
doing at 2:30 AM?  Second, did I really want to tell her I was up to use the
bathroom?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Occasionally people do
get up in the middle of the night,” I answered, hoping she was just being
slightly daft and would soon realize the awkwardness of her question.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Why?” Lisa went on,
undaunted.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Sometimes you just, you
know, need to get up for a few minutes,” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “That’s crazy!  For
what?” she went on.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Umm, I’m not quite sure
how to put this, Lisa---” I began.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Who?” she asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Okay.  Now I started
looking around to make sure there wasn’t a hidden camera somewhere or an
on-location audience laughing at my predicament.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You.  You’re Lisa,
according to that,” I explained, pointing at her name tag.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            She looked down at the
name tag and then looked up with a sudden look of realization, as if she’d just
understood a series of grunts from a slobbering two-year-old.  “Oh, my name’s
not Lisa.  We just have to wear a name tag, so I pick up whichever one is the
closest when I come in every morning.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So what’s your real name,
then?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Willow,” she said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay, then, Willow, how
do I put this?” I began again.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No one calls me
Willow,” she said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I sighed and let my head
fall toward my chest.  “Okay.  I give up.  What does everyone call you?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Carrie.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The thought did cross my
mind to ask her why she hadn’t just said that in the first place, but I stifled
it in the interest of ending my interaction with her as quickly as possible.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Great.  Carrie,...uh… 
Where were we?” I asked, a little bewildered at that point.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Something nutso about
you getting up at 2:30 in the morning, for some reason,” she prompted, fiddling
with a strand of her blue hair.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay, you know what? 
It doesn’t matter why I was up at 2:30 or even 4:00 in the morning.  I was up. 
I tried to get a drink of water---” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Why, did you eat
something?” asked Carrie-Willow.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No,” I said, taking a
deep breath.  “I was thirsty.  But the water wouldn’t come on.  So I called the
front desk and the guy said that they were having water problems.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Who was it?” she asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I don’t know.  Don’t
you all have a call log or a set of hand-off notes or something that you could
look at?  How about a schedule?  You could tell who was working this morning,”
I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Carrie-Willow shrugged
and moseyed back through a doorway into a back room, still fiddling with her
hair.  Soon, she returned, this time playing with a rubber band around her
fingers.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So, did you find out
about the water problems?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, but Ian was working
last night,” she said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Did Ian leave any notes
or talk to you about any problems last night?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, I usually try to
come in late so I don’t have to talk to him.  He’s weird,” she said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So, how do you find out
if something went wrong the night before?” I asked patiently.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I ask Bob,” she said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Great!  Can you ask
Bob, then?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Depends.  What room are
you staying in?” she asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “301,” I answered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            There was a pause as she
looked up from her rubber band play and made note of my appearance.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You’re not Higgs,” she
said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Darn tootin,” I
answered.  We’d finally come to agreement on something.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You’re the guy who gave
the room away, aren’t you?” she asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I shrugged.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            She put the rubber band
down and turned her attention to her computer terminal.  After punching three
or four keys, I was sure I could both hear angels singing and see a pillar of
heavenly light begin to filter in from the ceiling.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I see,” she said.  “Oh,
it says that there was a busted water pipe last night and that there might be
some air in the pipes that will filter out over the next day or so.  By the
way,” she said as she turned her attention back to her computer, “I’ve never
seen a CTR ring with a red background like that.  Did you get it off the
Internet from somewhere cheap?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Having proven to me that
she did, in fact, know something about the Church by her CTR ring comment, and
with only a little more tribulation, Carrie-Willow demonstrated that she did also
actually know the locations of the Martin Harris Farm, the ice cream shack I
remembered from years past as being worth a visit, and the Peter Whitmer Farm. 
She ended up drawing a map for me on a sheet from a puppy-dog shaped pad of
paper in sparkly blue ink.  It showed the places we wanted to visit, which I
carried with me out to the van where Megan and the kids were waiting for me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, Jared,” Megan was
saying into her phone.  “You don’t need to feed our kitty today, either. 
Remember, we talked about this yesterday?  The kitty is with us---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “He is?” I asked,
snapping my head Megan’s way as I shut the van door behind me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan put her hand over
the phone’s mouthpiece and whispered, “Yes, we can’t leave him in the hotel
room.  Can you imagine what a mess he might make?  And he might escape when the
housekeeping people opened the door.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah, that’d be a
tragedy,” I said, reaching back for my seatbelt.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan then uncovered the
phone and said, “That’s right, Jared.  Angel will be with us till we come home.... 
Yes, I guess you could come and feed him then, if you want....  Okay, then, bye
Jared.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So let me get this
straight,” I said, turning the ignition key.  “We have to take the cat around
with us everywhere we go today?  How is that going to work?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I have him in his new
carrier!  He loves it!” announced Piper happily, holding up the newly bought
cage precariously above her.  Angel was cowering as low to the floor of the
cage as he could get, the hair on his back bristling with love.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What will we do with
him when we’re visiting places?” I asked, backing out of our parking spot. 
“You can’t leave a pet alone in a vehicle, remember?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Piper has a leash!”
Marianna answered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Somehow, this plan
seemed a little---no, <i>completely</i> fraught with opportunities for failure,
but I decided to show faith in them.  After all, against all odds, we now had
an “okay” place to stay for the week.  It wasn’t perfect, but it was better
than the mud bog alternative.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Five bucks says---”
came Lauren’s voice again.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Shush!” shushed Megan
quickly, although I felt like the odds were in Lauren’s favor myself.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Megan, can you help me
with this map?” I asked, handing her the map Carrie-Willow had drawn for us.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What is this?” she
asked, eyeing the puppy-shaped piece of paper, turning it over in her hands.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The girl at the front
desk is a little...eccentric.  It was upside down when she was drawing it for
me, so I think the puppy’s head is south.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So she knew where these
places were, after all?” Megan asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes, the girl behind
the desk did, in fact, seem to know where they were.  So where do we need to go
to get to the Martin Harris Farm?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well,” said Megan,
continuing to turn the map over and over, finally settling on an orientation
which she found acceptable, “It looks like we’re headed for the puppy’s butt,
first.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Easton burst out
laughing.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Marianna turned her
attention back to the family from the window and said, “Huh?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Lauren turned a page.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Piper giggled.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Angel wimpered from
somewhere beside Piper.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And so, everything was
now in motion, and we were literally on the road leading to a church history
site in Palmyra---at least, according to the puppy-dog map Carrie-Willow had
drawn.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Look Dad!  It’s an
animal hospital!  Remember where it is in case Angel gets hurt,” yelled Piper
from the back.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Just think, kids.  This
is probably the same road Joseph Smith used to travel on in order to get to
Palmyra,” Megan announced.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Do you think he ever
broke the speed limit, too?” Easton asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “He was a prophet.  He never
broke the speed limit!” Piper yelled again, her safety patrol instincts kicking
in.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I sighed and eased my
foot off the accelerator.  I glanced reflexively again at the CTR ring they’d
given me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “But what if he had a
sick animal and needed to get to the animal hospital?  Do you think he would
have broken the speed limit then?” taunted Lauren from behind her book.  I took
this as a good sign.  She was at least paying attention to the conversation
around her.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, no!” cried Piper
with a sad face.  This was a conflict she had never considered.  She hugged
Angel’s new cage tighter and, in the process, tilted it so that Angel slid
unceremoniously to its back wall.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Don’t worry, Piper,”
Megan said, turning around to face them.  “It doesn’t really matter, anyway,”
she said, making threatening movements with her forehead and eyebrows at
Lauren, “Because they didn’t have speed limits, cars or the animal hospital
back then.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Do you think they had
stoplights?” asked Easton with alarm, his hands wrapped around the seat in
front of him with a death-grip.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And then I, too, became
suddenly aware that we were coming to the main intersection of Palmyra a little
too quickly.  Well, maybe much too quickly.  And our light was red.  I slammed
on the brake and with a great meow, we lurched to a halt just short of the
intersection ahead of us with several families watching suspiciously from the
sidewalks.  I saw one mother put her arm around her children to whisk them away
from the scene as quickly as possible.  I smiled sheepishly at the onlookers
and then took a deep breath.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Is one of these the
Palmyra Temple?” Easton asked, looking out the windows at the four churches
that surrounded the intersection we were sitting at.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, these are the Four
Corner Churches.  Each one is from a different religion, representing that
Palmyra is a religiously diverse town,” Marianna recited.  I had to check to
make sure she wasn’t reading.  She wasn’t.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The traffic light turned
green.  Megan consulted the puppy map, pointed the way, and we proceeded
straight through the intersection.  I glanced eastward down the main street and
saw hundreds of people milling about on quaint looking sidewalks with lots of
red, white and blue banners strung across the street between tall, black,
antique-looking street lamps.  Red brick buildings on either side gave the
street the look of a perfect avenue for a Fourth of July parade.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Uh, oh,” Megan
mumbled.  “Did you see all those people?  I forgot that this is the busy
season.  We might have to wait in line to see the Martin Harris Farm.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We continued north
(toward the puppy’s <i>derriere</i>) for another couple of minutes, all of us
looking around for the cobblestone house that Marianna promised us would be
there.  Sure enough, after a short drive, there it was.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Three red chimneys
topped the house.  The main section of the house, with a covered stoop in
front, was two stories tall.  Two windows flanked each side of the front door
with matching windows on the second story.  A one-story wing of the house on
the right side was fronted by a porch.  The entire facade of the house was made
up of rows and rows of cobblestones set in mortar.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “This is it!  This is
it!” Marianna squealed, bouncing in her seat.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It looks like there’s a
parking lot on the right,” Megan pointed out.  I turned into the unexpectedly
empty parking lot and pulled into a white-lined spot.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The manicured lawn out
front was complemented by well-kept flower beds which surrounded the house and
the walkways.  From within the deep red shredded mulch, tufts of ornamental
grasses and low-growing bushes framed the house beautifully.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wow, looks like we beat
the crowd here!” I exclaimed as we all piled out of the van into the empty
parking lot.  “Everyone must be visiting the Sacred Grove.”  This was good, in
my eyes: proof that I could get us around to the sites with expert timing, no
Higgs required.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Piper, honey, there’s a
tree over there.  Why don’t you tie Angel to it while we go take the tour of
the house?” said Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay, Mom,” Piper
chirped, skipping across the lawn toward the tree, bouncing Angel’s cage up and
down as she went.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Martin Harris must have
been a busy guy, gathering up all the stones for his house like that,” Easton
commented.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Actually,” Marianna
said, “This isn’t Martin Harris’ original farm house.  His house was originally
built here, but he left Palmyra in the early 1830s.  The original house later
burned down close to 1850, and then this house was built.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’m back,” Piper
announced as she ran up to us.  We all started walking toward the front of the
house.  “So what’s with the rocks all over the house, anyway?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “They’re not rocks. 
They’re called ‘lake stones.’  They were brought here from Lake Ontario,”
Marianna answered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So, if this isn’t the
real Martin Harris Farm, then why are we here?” Lauren asked, her arms folded
and her hip stuck out.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            To be honest, I actually
kind of followed Lauren’s logic on that point.  However, I decided to put on a
gentle fatherly face and answer wisely, “Otherwise we’d be sitting in the hotel
all day.”  Megan scowled at me.  I just shrugged my shoulders.  By then, we’d
all arrived at the large sign near the front of the house, so I quickly turned
my attention to it and started reading.  “The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints was founded in this area, and Martin Harris was a leading
figure in its early history.  He helped---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Why don’t you just let
Marianna recite it for you?” interrupted Lauren.  “She’s memorized the whole
web site, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Actually, that’s
probably a good idea,” Megan suggested.  We all agreed that, since there didn’t
seem to be a line, and since it was a nice morning and the sun hadn’t yet made
being outside unbearable, we’d go ahead and walk around the outside of the
house and enjoy the fresh breeze, the smell of the cut grass, and the sounds of
birds singing while Marianna told us everything she’d learned about the Martin
Harris Farm.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As we rounded the house
and were heading back to the front, Marianna told us that Joseph Smith, Sr. and
his son, Hyrum had helped to dig a well in front of the house.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Is that why there’s a
water fountain out front?” Megan asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Let’s all go take a
drink so we can say we’ve done it!” Easton called out.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I figured it would be an
exciting conclusion to listening to Marianna’s history lesson, so I kicked off
first, followed closely by Easton, then Piper and Marianna.  I suspected Megan
was holding back to keep Lauren company, who would never do something so weird
as race to drink water from an outdoor water fountain.  Easton beat us all and
took the first drink, followed by Piper, and then Marianna.  I was surprised
when Lauren took a drink, then Megan, and finally me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Now we can all cross
that one off our ‘stuff to do before we die’ lists,” I said, wiping my mouth
with my sleeve.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What do you think,
everyone?” Megan asked, shading her eyes with her hand and looking up at the
sun.  “Should we go in for the tour before it gets too warm?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We made our way up the
sidewalk to the door on the right side of the house.  As we approached, I could
see another man and woman already inside, both of them looking off to the left
toward the main part of the house.  They didn’t seem to old enough or dressed
formally enough to be a senior missionary couple acting as tour guides, so I
surmised they must be another group waiting to tour the house.  I thought that
was strange since I hadn’t seen any other cars in the parking lot.  I reached
out to turn the doorknob to open the door for us to enter, but the knob didn’t
turn.  The couple inside jerked their heads around to look at us, so I motioned
for them to open the door for us.  The man walked slowly over and opened the
door.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Thanks,” I said
quickly.  I took the door from the man inside and ushered Piper on in under my
arm, followed by the rest of the kids, Megan and finally me.  As we stood there
in that first room waiting for the tour to begin, I looked over at the man
again and gave him another friendly nod of appreciation.  He had a strange look
on his face, so I guessed what was happening almost immediately.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Sorry,” I apologized
quickly, rubbing my left eye once more.  “I got shampoo in my eye this morning
and it’s been twitching ever since then.  Don’t worry, I’m not winking at you.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hey!  I have an idea! 
Let’s all go get our picture taken in front of the water fountain while we’re
waiting!” Megan suggested.  Then, a little more quietly to me, “Maybe you could
ask that man to take the picture for us.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Sir, would you mind
taking a picture of my family out front?” I asked him.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Now, I’ve seen puzzled
looks before, but the look on that man’s face was beyond puzzlement---he looked
downright bewildered.  I couldn’t understand why, though.  All we wanted him to
do was point and click.  I took the camera from Megan and turned it on as we
all made our way outside.  The man slowly accepted the camera from me and I
showed him the button to push in order to take the picture.  Megan and the kids
and I all stood in front of the water fountain with our best, kindergarten
picture day smiles and the guy took our picture.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Can we do a crazy
picture?” Piper asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah!  Let’s do a crazy
one!” said Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            So, we all contorted
into various weird shapes, with even weirder faces, crossed eyes and all, for
another picture.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “How about a pyramid?”
asked Marianna.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Our photographer
shrugged slowly so we all formed a pyramid---Megan, Easton and I on the bottom
followed by Lauren and Marianna in the middle with Piper on top.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Too bad Angel’s not
here to be the star on top!” Piper lamented.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay everyone, let’s
get back in before it’s too late,” said Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We all filed back in.  I
held the door for our photographer (still with that bewildered expression) and
closed it behind him.  I was starting to wonder if that was just the way he
looked in everyday life.  We all stood there looking at each other for a tense
moment.  In order to ease my own nervousness, I began to look around.  That was
when I started to notice that things were a little...off.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Looking toward the main
part of the house, through an arched partition, there was a table, much like
the kind of dining room table we had in our own dining room back at home.  On
the right side of this table, seated on a chair wearing a pink bathrobe and
white pajama bottoms, bare feet swinging in the air, was a little girl with
long brown hair.  She was hunched over a bowl with a spoonful of cereal halfway
to her mouth, her eyes staring at me and the rest of my family.  Across the
table from her, wearing super hero pajamas and a plastic fireman’s hat, with a
ratted blanket over his shoulder, sat a little boy, crunching on a piece of
toast.  Somewhere in the background, I could hear a children’s program playing
on a TV.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And suddenly, I came to
a horrible realization.  As the color and the smile drained from my face, I
looked around the room we were standing in.  The man who’d helped us by taking
our picture and the woman were leaning up against a kitchen sink across the
room from us.  A refrigerator, oven, cabinets, and other kitchen accoutrements
surrounded us, too.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Do we know you?” asked
the woman, who I now noticed was wearing fuzzy pink slippers and pulling her
own bathrobe closer around her.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Is this the Martin
Harris Farm?” Megan asked cheerfully.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hey, look!  Are they
serving breakfast?” Easton asked, his eyes on the kids eating at the table in
the next room.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Megan,” I croaked
quickly, “This is their home!”  Then, turning to the man, “I am so sorry, sir. 
We thought this was the waiting room for a tour.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “That’s okay,” he said,
his face hardening a little from bewilderment to annoyance.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “We’ll just head out,
now,” I continued, reaching behind my back to open the door behind me and
motioning for the kids and Megan to leave.  I turned to leave, as well, letting
the door go for the owner to hold, who was now seeing us out, and then close
behind us.  As I turned, I ran straight into the back of Megan, who had stopped
short of the main sidewalk.  There, right beside the well that Joseph Smith,
Sr. and his son Hyrum had dug with their own hallowed hands, in a little
cleared-out crater within the deep red mulch, was Angel, his yellow leash
trailing behind him, squatting, leaving a few bits of used Super Big Mart cat
food.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Um,” I said, turning to
face the now red-faced man behind me, “You wouldn’t happen to have a plastic
bag I could borrow, would you?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%;page-break-before:always'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><b><span id='Chapter-6'>6</span></b></p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Without much grace, we
escaped from the Martin Harris Farm, with a still living cat (much to my
disappointment).  Our next big discovery of the day was fry sauce.  Apparently,
it’s a perennial favorite at the little burger and ice cream shack at the east
end of the main drag in Palmyra.  I had gone out of my way to schedule lunch
there because I’d learned about it during my trips to Palmyra with my ward and
stake youth groups growing up: it was supposedly “the” place to go for pageant
performers.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            When we arrived, we
found dozens of teenagers and their “minders” scattered amongst some outdoor
picnic tables.  Megan and the kids claimed the end of one while I was dispatched
to wait in line and order lunches for everyone.  Standing in line, I noticed
that many of the teenagers were wearing lanyards around their necks identifying
them as pageant performers.  They ran between tables chattering back and forth
with each other as kids do.  The guy standing in line in front of me seemed to
be one of the adult “minders.”  Given that my goal was for my family to have
the best Palmyra vacation ever, and that one of the things I wanted to make
happen was for us to get into the pageant somehow (proving that I could
accomplish this without Higgs’ help), I decided to probe a little to find out
how I might be able to make that happen.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So,” I began
creatively, “are you here with all these kids?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            He turned and smiled. 
“Yeah, my group is over there,” he said, pointing to a table.  “Or, at least
most of them are.  Looks like a few may have escaped to some other tables.” One
of the kids in his group, I noticed, seemed to be watching us closely.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You all are in the
pageant this year?” I asked.  Kind of a stupid question.  It was a little
obvious.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah, we’ve been
getting ready for several days, now.  Everyone’s really excited for opening
night.  And the dance, too, but really, pageant performances are what we’re all
here for.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So how did you get into
this?” I asked, starting to hone in on the information I was really after.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “My family and I filled
out the papers last year.  We went through some interviews and were selected,”
he said simply.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Obviously that route was
not going to work for us.  With two days before opening night, that process was
long gone.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Does anyone ever just
show up and get to be in the pageant?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I suppose if you were a
general authority or someone like that.  Maybe some prominent member of the
church...”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Like a Higgins.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “...But not really, not
that I know of,” he said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We continued chatting as
we shuffled forward in line.  I asked about his favorite scene.  He told me it
was definitely the giant destruction scene just before the appearance of the
Savior.  I made mental note of that and then we bought our food and separated.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            My family agreed that
fry sauce was probably one of those strange new elements that kept getting
tacked on to the end of the periodic table.  We had great fun watching Easton
pretend his fries were: diving airplanes, flags being planted on the moon, and
some sort of special basketball game where the ball is a fry and the hoop is
the little cup of fry sauce.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Who wants ice cream,
now?” I asked, now that everyone had finished the “nutritional” portion of the
lunch meal.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I headed back to wait in
line for the ice cream orders.  This time, I felt a tug on my shirt from
behind.  I turned and saw an older teenager, one of the pageant performers, the
one who had been watching the chaperon and I talking earlier, and he was
looking around nervously.  His lanyard said his name was “Tim.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hey, I heard you asking
one of the chaperones earlier about getting into the pageant,” said Tim
quietly, quickly looking at my hand, and then again glancing around to make
sure no one was listening to us.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I just wondered if
anyone---” I started.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I assumed you were
asking about you and your family,” interrupted Tim, indicating with a nod that
he had surmised that Megan and the kids were my family.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I nodded.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Look, I don’t know much
about this, but I’ve been coming here for several years.  The normal way.  You
know, through the application and selection process.  But sometimes, we see a
group of new faces in the line up prior to a scene in the performance.  Usually
just for one night.  And then they’re gone.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I kept nodding to
encourage him to continue.  He looked again at my right hand, this time
appearing to focus on my CTR ring.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah, I know it looks
like a knock-off,” I said.  “But my kids gave it to me as a gift, so I like it
anyway.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’ve heard,” he
continued, still staring at the CTR ring, “that there’s this guy who calls
himself Gadianton who gets these groups into the performances.  So everyone
calls these one-time performers ‘Gadianton’s Band’.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Do you know how to, you
know, get hold of this ‘Gadianton?’” I asked softly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Tim, come on, let’s
go!” called one of the chaperones from the door of a large van in the parking
lot.  Tim took out a piece of paper and scribbled “Gadianton the Great” on it
and shoved it into my hand.  “Search for this on the Internet.”  Then he headed
off to his ride.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I returned to our table
with the ice cream orders and a lead to follow up on.  I would need to see if I
could find this “Gadianton the Great” somehow.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Look, Dad,” said
Marianna, handing me what looked like a business card for the burger shack. 
“It’s a ‘Buy Twelve Get One Free for the Prophet’ card!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Really?” said Easton. 
Anything to do with food was something he was intently interested in.  “Quick! 
I need a pen.  It says that the card’s no good unless the customer’s name and
address are on it.”  Megan handed him a pen and Easton quickly lowered it to
the card and then suddenly stopped.  “Oh no!  It says you have to be eighteen
years old to use this card.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Just put your dad’s
name on it,” Megan suggested.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay, then I’ll take it
up to the counter and get the hole punched out,” said Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            After Easton had
finished filling out and punching my own personal golden ticket, we headed back
to the van.  On our drive back to the main road, we passed by a grocery store,
where Marianna pointed out the Garr family walking out to the parking lot
carrying plastic bags of food and, it looked like to me, a couple of large
packages of toilet paper.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You’d think they could
just call the front desk to ask for more toilet paper,” said Megan, voicing
what I had just been thinking.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wow.  I wonder where
they’ve been driving,” said Easton, drawing our attention to the large splatter
patterns of mud behind each wheel of the car they were loading their packages
into.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “They’re new members, so
we should be friendly and wave hi to them,” Megan suggested.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            All the windows on the
right side of our van went down and (except for Lauren), everyone reached out
to wave and yell “hi!” to them as we slowed to go by.  The older Sister Garr,
on seeing us go by waving, stopped in her tracks so quickly that the three bags
she was carrying swayed forward before stopping and swinging back.  Then she
stared at us, scowling.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As we passed by, Megan
and I both exchanged puzzled glances over Sister Garr’s reaction.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Maybe she didn’t want
to be seen buying toilet paper?” Megan suggested.  “Oh, and that reminds me: I
forgot to bring plates.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Plates?  For what?” I
asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Paper plates.  For a
picnic,” she said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “That would have been
classic---us with a picnic spread out on the lawn of the Martin Harris Farm!”
said Easton, laughing.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Do you think we should
have warned the Garrs about the Martin Harris Farm?” Megan asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I shrugged and pulled up
to the intersection where the Four Corners churches stood.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So where are we headed,
now?” I asked, catching Marianna’s eye in the rear-view mirror.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Marianna again pulled
her pink and purple notebook out and read, “The Peter Whitmer Farm.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Which way should we
go?” I asked Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Looks like the Whitmer
Farm,” said Megan, turning the puppy map right-side up, “is not too far past
the hotel.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We turned south out of
Palmyra on Canandaigua road again, passing the Animal Hospital, the Palmyra
Town Hall (“Is <i>that</i> the Palmyra Temple, Mom?”), and our hotel, where
Bob, the hotel maintenance guy, was out in the side parking lot conversing with
a man wearing overalls beside a truck labeled, “Wayne County Water
Department.”  A few minutes later, we passed by the Hill Cumorah.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wow, look at all the
chairs!” Marianna observed.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “How do people know
where to sit, Mom?” Piper asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’m not sure.  I’ve
never been here before.  Maybe your dad knows,” said Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As the family’s sage
Palmyra scholar, only by coincidence did I actually know the answer to this
one.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Seating is supposedly
first-come-first-served.  But, do you see those blankets draped over some of
the chairs?” I pointed out.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah,” some of the kids
answered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “That’s how people
reserve seats,” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So, if we wanted good
seats, all we’d have to do is take someone’s blanket and move it back a row?”
came Lauren’s voice from behind her book.  Again, she <i>was</i> listening.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’m not sure I’d want
to have that on my conscience for the rest of my life,” Megan said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah, stealing front
row seats from someone at the Hill Cumorah pageant would be like stealing
someone’s scriptures!” said Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Or the bishop’s church
keys,” retorted Lauren.  Easton’s smile evaporated quickly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We continued driving
south, watching for the characteristic blue and white signs indicating church
history sites.  After another ten minutes or so, we crossed over an Interstate
highway and came to an intersection.  It was becoming clear that
Carrie-Willow’s puppy-dog map was not necessarily drawn to scale.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well, it says we’re
supposed to turn onto highway 96 at the puppy’s left nostril.  That sign says
96.  Better go that way,” said Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Marianna, how far away
is Fayette from Palmyra?” I finally asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I have no idea,”
answered Marianna cheerfully.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “How did you group the
places we are visiting?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh!  I know this one,”
Marianna began excitedly.  “I put all the ‘farms’ first, then the ‘groves,’
then the...”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So, you figured all the
farms would be right next to each other?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah!” she said
cheerfully.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wouldn’t it have made
more sense to maybe group our excursions so that the places we visited were
close together?”  In the rearview mirror, Marianna’s eyebrows started to pull
up together in the center.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Out of the corner of my
eye, I could see Megan barely shaking her head “no” at me, again.  So the wiser
person in me decided to take the hint.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It’ll be alright,
Marianna,” I said, putting on the blinker to head towards the puppy’s left
ear.  “We’re here to have the perfect vacation together.  So tell us about the
Whitmer Farm.  Maybe it’ll help the trip to go quicker.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We would find out later
that we couldn’t have picked too many places to visit in the Palmyra area that
were farther apart than the Martin Harris and Peter Whitmer farms.  It took
almost an hour for us to make it all the way down to Fayette, New York, where
another big blue sign directed us onto a small side road leading to the Whitmer
Farm.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            At the apex of a
horseshoe driveway and parking lot sat a large white visitor’s center.  Just to
the west of the visitor’s center was a rough-hewn log home.  While some people
were milling about on the wood-chip walkways, several were seated at picnic
tables under trees having lunch.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay everyone,” I
announced as we pulled into a parking spot, “I’m going to leave the windows
open so that Angel can stay in his carrier inside the van.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Is that safe?” asked
Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah, what if Angel has
to use the bathroom?” cried Piper.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What if he has to
puke?” asked Lauren.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            While I really wanted to
avoid Angel escaping from his leash again, the memory of Angel vomit gave me
pause.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay then.  You
convinced me, Lauren,” I said.  So we put Angel in his carrier beside the van
in the shade and tied it to the bumper.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Angel’s going to be
alright.  The thermometer on the dash says the temperature outside is only
eighty-two degrees, and sitting in the shade, he should be fine.  All he ever
does in the afternoons is sleep anyway,” I reassured them.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “This has got to be the
temple, right?” asked Easton, looking up at the shiny gold spire sitting on top
of the building’s cupola.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, this is the visitor’s
center for the Peter Whitmer Farm,” Marianna corrected him.  “They made it
extra-special because it’s the site where the Church was first organized.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan and I led the kids
up the sidewalk to the entrance of the visitor’s center.  I opened the door and
held it for several people who were following behind us.  Once in, everyone
passed by an senior missionary couple who were rapidly shaking hands with every
person who went by.  I lost sight of the kids for a few seconds in the crowd,
but we all managed to reassemble in the red carpeted foyer.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh no!” Megan said
quietly, patting her pockets.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What’s wrong?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I forgot the camera in
the van.  Lauren, can you go get it?  It’s in the glove compartment,” Megan
said, handing Lauren the keys from her pocket.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Lauren, dressed as she
usually was in all black, took the keys and walked nonchalantly back to the
entrance door, the other members of today’s group staring and whispering as she
passed them by.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We heard someone clear
their throat and begin speaking at the front of the foyer.  “Brothers and
Sisters,” began the husband of the older missionary couple.  He was standing in
front of a set of white double doors.  Through the rectangular glass windows in
these doors, we could see another group of visitors gathered in the room beyond
being led around by a pair of young sister missionaries.  “Brothers and
Sisters, if you could all come a little closer to us over here, please.  We’ll
get started just as soon as we can.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “At least he’s not the
homeowner this time,” I whispered to Megan.  She smiled.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’m Elder Rindlisbacher
and this is Sister Rindlisbacher.”  Here, he pointed to a white-haired, elderly
sister wearing silver horn-rimmed glasses standing beside him.  “Welcome to the
Peter Whitmer Farm.  The building we’re in right now...”  He motioned stiffly
with a gray-haired hand to indicate the walls around us.  Several of the people
in the tour group craned their necks around to look at the white walls and red
carpet.  “This is the stake center that was built for the sesquicentennial
anniversary of the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Dad,” Piper whispered
loud enough to set Sister Rindlisbacher’s hearing aide whistling.  “Does the
Church really have bigfoot’s toenail?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Some questions demand
your full attention.  This was one of them.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What?” I asked her,
doing a double-take.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “He said something about
the Church’s ‘sasquatch toenail’,” said Piper, pointing at Elder Rindlisbacher.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, no, he said ‘sesquicentennial.’ 
It means ‘150<sup>th</sup>,’ Piper,” I answered quickly, smiling and nodding at
Sister Rindlisbacher in apology.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Elder Rindlisbacher
frowned slightly at me and continued.  I guessed he was old-school and didn’t
like people interrupting his presentation.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            He continued: “During
the April 1980 General Conference of the Church, President Spencer W. Kimball
and other general authorities assembled here to conduct a special session of
the conference.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Lauren re-entered the
door at this point, but, surprisingly, waited patiently on that side of the
room rather than cause a disturbance during the presentation.  She held up the
camera and keys.  Megan nodded and gave her a thumbs-up.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Elder Rindlisbacher
looked over at Sister Rindlisbacher.  She had just finished adjusting the
volume on a hearing aide that looked to be half-in and half-out and was patting
her bluish-white hair back over her ear.  “The re-created log home across the
way,” she clacked through her dentures, “was built especially for that
occasion.”  She pointed a gnarled hand over her shoulder to indicate the wrong
direction to where the log home was.  “The rebuilt home is built on the same
foundation as the original home of the Whitmers.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Sister Rindlisbacher
went on to explain something about Brigham Young University archaeology
professors which I only vaguely listened to, being more caught up in observing
some of the people in our tour group.  There was another family with kids a
little older than ours.  Two young couples stood together off to one side of
the group.  One family to our left had three young children, all of which kept
tugging at the father’s pant leg and pointing at Lauren (apparently an ominous
sight they had never seen before in their lives).  There were two older women
near the front of our group that I couldn’t see properly, but who seemed oddly
familiar to me for some reason.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Finally, the group ahead
of ours in the room beyond the double doors began to follow their sister
missionary tour guides out the far side.  I turned my attention back to Sister
Rindlisbacher and smiled what I hoped was an encouraging smile to her.  She
cringed and drew her sweater closer around her shoulders.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well, brothers and
sisters, it looks like we can now go into the informational display room,” said
Elder Rindlisbacher.  “If you all could enter through these doors, we can go
ahead and proceed with the next part of the tour.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Our group filed into the
informational display room.  Dozens of pictures depicting historic scenes from
church history in this area of New York lined the walls at eye level.  A few
padded benches were placed throughout the room for visitors to rest on.  A lone
wooden pedestal stood conspicuously out in front of the windows which lined the
south wall.  As we waited for the rest of our group to enter behind us, I began
perusing some of the many pictures hung on the north wall, nodding to Sister
Rindlisbacher to reassure her that I wasn’t going rogue and leaving the group. 
She seemed to me like she needed encouragement, so I kept trying to smile
nicely at her whenever I noticed her looking in my direction.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Elder Rindlisbacher
ushered the rest of the group into the room and made his way over to the wooden
pedestal.  On top of the pedestal sat a sculpture of Peter, James and John
ordaining Joseph Smith (or Oliver Cowdery---I wasn’t close enough to figure out
which of the sculpted figures was which---assuming that I could really pick
either one of them out of a crowd, that is).</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Brothers and Sisters,
we’d like to draw your attention over this way for a moment,” Elder
Rindlisbacher announced, his hands resting on opposite sides of the pedestal. 
“One of the events celebrating the sesquicentennial anniversary of the Church
was the creation of this time capsule.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            That explained why it
was out in the middle of the floor all by itself.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What did that word mean
again, Mom?” asked Piper.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “150<sup>th</sup>,”
Megan whispered quickly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “This time capsule will
be opened in the year 2030 to help celebrate the bicentennial anniversary of
the organization of the Church,” Sister Rindlisbacher completed.  I again
smiled at Sister Rindlisbacher as the image of “bison toenails” entered my
mind.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.45pt;line-height:200%'>The
Rindlisbachers both went on to explain more about some of the displays in the
room showing Priesthood authority in both antiquity and modern times.  They
bore their testimonies and invited us to begin thinking about friends we could
refer to the missionaries.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Now, I knew that Elder
and Sister Rindlisbacher were wonderful people, full of love for the Gospel. 
However, the meal from the burger shack and the restless sleep from the
previous night was starting to catch up with me, and this served to turn what
normally might have been an interesting discussion of historic events and
artifacts into a soporific slog.  I was literally fighting to stay awake. 
However, I didn’t want the Rindlisbachers to think that what they were saying
was, well, boring, so I fought to keep my eyes bright and interested-looking. 
I was to the point of asking Megan to pinch me a few times.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Then, out of the corner
of my half-closed, still-twitching left eye, I noticed a bright yellow Hummer pull
up next to, and then up and onto the curb outside.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            That did it.  My
drowsiness was suddenly cured.  I was wide awake.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “He’s not allowed to
park there!” I said to myself as Higgs hopped out of the driver’s side door
wearing unbelievably cool looking sunglasses, as if he were climbing out of the
cockpit of a sleek fighter jet.  Higgs’ son, Junior, eased himself from the
passenger side looking every bit as regal as his father.  I had to slyly shift
to the other side of Megan to follow them as they made their way to the back of
the Hummer and opened its back gate as it sat there in its illegal parking
spot.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So, Brothers and
Sisters, if you could all just follow Sister Rindlisbacher out the door on the
side there, we can continue the tour in the re-creation of the Whitmer’s log
home.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Great!  I would be able
to get a better look at what the Higginses were doing here.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Will, what are you
doing?” Megan whispered as I hurried away from her and the kids to get to the
door as fast as I could, practically knocking the two familiar looking older
ladies aside as I did so.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh...uh...I was just
anxious to...um...get the door for Sister Rindlisbacher!” I said.  Whew!  Good
save.  I glanced at Elder Rindlisbacher, who didn’t look happy.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Of course, my little
ruse meant that I’d have to hold the door and would end up having to wait
longer to see what the Higginses were up to.  Still, I had to follow through
with the save.  I pushed the door open and stood to the side for Sister
Rindlisbacher to go through, leaning to one side and then the other as
surreptitiously as I could to see if there were any way to see out into the
parking lot.  Without being absolutely obvious, about all I could see was the
front right fender of the yellow Hummer over the heads of, first, the two
familiar-looking old ladies, then the family with the little kids, then the two
young couples followed by Megan and Lauren.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Nice save, Dad,”
whispered Lauren as she walked by.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            What did that mean?  Had
she seen the Higginses’ Hummer arrive as well?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Finally, a rather stern
looking Elder Rindlisbacher came through.  He stopped right in front of me as
the rest of the group continued down the sidewalk following his shuffling wife.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Might I have a word
with you, young man?” he asked me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I jerked my head
backwards slightly in surprise, refocusing my eyes on him rather than the
yellow Hummer.  “Um, yeah, sure.  Is something wrong?”  And, I thought to
myself, is this going to keep me from seeing what Higgs is doing here?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            His eyes moved from one
to the other of my eyes, his mouth turned down even below his jowls in a
frown.  For some reason, I was suddenly reminded of that primary song about a
frowny face.  (It’s always bad when you think of something funny in a somber
moment.)  I could only guess at what it was he wanted to talk to me about.  Had
I tracked gum through the information center?  Was I in trouble for looking
around at the pictures by myself apart from the group?  Had I fallen asleep
during his presentation and not known it?  Had Carrie-Willow called from the
hotel to say that the water problem was fixed?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Sir, my wife says that
you have been flirting with her all throughout the tour, and I want it to
stop,” he said sternly, stamping his foot on the word “stop.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Well.  What could I say
to that?  Sister Rindlisbacher had to be at least eighty years old.  How could
anyone possibly think I was coming on to someone over twice my age?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Um, I’m very sorry,
Elder Rindlisbacher.  I’m not sure what I could have done to give you, er, I
mean her, that impression,” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’ve been watching you
smile at her throughout the whole presentation!” he grumbled.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well, yeah, I have
been, but that’s been to encourage her.  You all are really giving a great
presentation---” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Then what’s with all
the winking?” he barked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Huh?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The winking!  You keep
winking at my wife.  Now, we may be a little bit older, but in our day, I tell
you, she was a looker!  And she still is!  So---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Elder Rindlisbacher,” I
interrupted.  “I got shampoo in my eye this morning and it’s been bothering me
ever since.  I’ve been blinking that eye all day.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Likely story,” he said,
a little more calmly, this time peering a little more deeply into my eyes.  I
don’t think I’d ever prayed for red eyes before in my life, but there’s always
a first time for everything.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Sir, it’s true.  I have
a beautiful wife of my own, and have no designs toward yours,” I said, holding
my hands up in mock surrender.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            He continued to stare at
me, then his forehead lines eased a little and he stood up a little
straighter.  “Well okay, then.  I guess that sounds all right.  But you’d
better be on your best behavior.  There’s no telling what Beulah will do if she
thinks you’re still trying to court her.  I’ll just try to kip on up there and
explain it all to her.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Elder Rindlisbacher left
me there, still holding the door, gasping slightly for air.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “This’ll make a great
entry for our blog!” Elder Rindlisbacher chuckled as he hobbled down the
sidewalk.  “The great-great grandkids will love it!”  I, for one, was amazed at
and thankful for his quick mood change.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Just as I felt
adequately recovered and ready to allow the door to close and follow Elder
Rindlisbacher out, Easton and Piper appeared in the doorway behind me, from the
direction of the visitor’s center.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Easton?  Piper?” I
asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh!” said Easton,
surprised.  “Sorry we’re late, Dad.  Were you looking for us?”  He and Piper
kept stealing glances back into the visitor’s center.  I suddenly suspected
that he’d left some kind of surprise inside.  I leaned in to follow his look,
but didn’t see anything.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Um, sort of.”  I
guessed that it wouldn’t be good form to have forgotten to be concerned about
the whereabouts of half my children, would it?  “Are you two ready to go on?” I
asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I put my arm around
their shoulders, partly to steady myself---I was still reeling a little from
Elder Rindlisbacher’s scolding---and partly to make sure they stayed with the
rest of our group.  We started down the sidewalk toward the log home.  As the
door fell closed behind us, I returned to thoughts of what I’d been so anxious
to see out on the curb.  I looked out to where the yellow Hummer had been.  It
was still parked up on the curb, as if Higgs had some special “park anywhere
you want” license!  The back gate of the vehicle was open and Higgs was
carrying a large white case marked with a red cross.  Junior was in the midst
of picking up another case just like it from the back of the Hummer.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What are they doing?” I
asked myself.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Who?” asked Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Um, the missionaries up
at the door,” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Looks like they’re
opening the door,” said Easton, not completely sure why I couldn’t ascertain
this fact for myself.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Again, I took another
quick look over to see what the Higginses were doing now.  Higgs  had just
balanced his case on one hip to hold the entrance door to the visitor’s center
open for a new batch of visitors.  Junior was just stepping up onto the
sidewalk from the driveway.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Where have you two
been?” Megan asked, looking from Easton to Piper, as we walked up to her and
the other two girls, jerking me out of my surveillance mode.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “We got held up,” I
answered, trying for once to be a peacemaker.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Brothers and Sisters,”
called Elder Rindlisbacher, his hand turning a key in the bright red door on
the front of the log home, “As we enter the log home, move all the way to the
back so we can fit everyone in.  Please stay on the outside of the protective
rope, as well.”  He then swung the door open with a loud creak and allowed
Sister Rindlisbacher to hobble in first.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I took one last quick
glance back at the Hummer.  Junior had stopped on the sidewalk with his load
held out in front of him.  His eyes, much to my horror, were now focused
squarely on our parked van under the tree on the other side of the parking
lot.  Reluctantly, I had to follow Megan and the kids as they disappeared into
the log home in front of me.  Just before I was pushed in, I saw Junior
scanning the crowds around the visitor’s center, as if he were looking for
someone.  I had a hunch I knew who he was looking for.  Someone with spunk, no
doubt.  And I didn’t like it.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            When the two familiar
looking older ladies had finally pulled themselves up and into the front room
of the log home, Elder Rindlisbacher closed the door, cutting off my view of
Junior.  Then, he began his spiel.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “As we spoke a little
earlier, this, of course, is not the original home that was built by the
Whitmers, but it was built on the same foundation that was uncovered by a BYU
archaeological study.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The room was, as Elder
Rindlisbacher had announced before we entered, partitioned in half.  We
tourists had to stay behind a rope which “protected” the early nineteenth
century table sitting in the center of the room.  Behind the table from the
tourists’ point of view was a stone fireplace with a rough-hewn wooden mantel
hung with period cooking utensils along with bundles and sprigs of herbs.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Over a small side table
where a large Bible was open to somewhere in the Book of Job, a mullioned
window faced the parking lot.  Normally, I would have thought the way that the
glass distorted the shapes of objects outside interesting and unique, but at
the moment it was distorting my view of the yellow Hummer and Higgs returning
from the visitor’s center.  It looked like Higgs had stopped where his son was
still scanning the grounds for I-thought-I-knew-who.  Higgs then nudged his son
toward the visitor’s center while he returned to the Hummer for another load.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The Whitmers came from
Pennsylvania and settled here in 1809.  This room here is the kitchen, dining
room and living room all in one.  Behind you,” said Elder Rindlisbacher,
pointing to the doorway behind the group, “is the master bedroom, or parlor, as
they called it back then.”  I tried to surreptitiously crane my neck but could
still see no sign of the Higginses coming back to their Hummer at this point.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Sister Rindlisbacher
then took over.  “Brothers and Sisters, many important events took place in and
around this home---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I know, I know!” cried
Marianna, her hand in the air.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan looked over at me
and expressed with her eyes, “That’s Marianna, for you!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Sister Rindlisbacher was
a little confused.  I doubt she’d ever had to deal with a hand go up like that,
but she went ahead and called on Marianna anyway.  “Yes, dear?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The translation of the
Book of Mormon was completed here, the three witnesses were shown the Gold
Plates here, and the Church was organized here!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Sister Rindlisbacher
smiled weakly, then shrugged.  Somehow, I got the feeling that Marianna had just
taken all her best material.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Suddenly, I caught site
of Higgs arriving back at the Hummer.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Elder Rindlisbacher now
took the floor.  “Now, brothers and sisters, if you could all---yes, son?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Does anyone ever eat at
this table?” I heard Easton ask.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Sometimes, the mission
president will schedule a special dinner here for visiting general authorities
or VIPs,” Elder Rindlisbacher answered.  I rolled my eyes and looked at the
yellow Hummer again.  I’m sure anyone with the last name Higgins would be encompassed
in that “VIP” category.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Alright, Brothers and
Sisters, if---yes, young lady?” said Elder Rindlisbacher, again having his
groove thrown off in mid-sentence.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What’s this door in the
middle of the floor for?” Piper asked, pointing at a trap door with a
rusty-looking ring for a handle.  It was placed in the floor in front of the
table with the Bible.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Elder Rindlisbacher took
out a handkerchief and wiped his forehead.  “That would have been a place for
food storage.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wow!  Like a year’s
supply?” Piper exclaimed.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Do you think they kept
a year’s supply of ammunition down there, too?” Easton asked quietly, not
really to anyone in particular.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “And maybe food for the
animals, too?  What’s in there, now?” Piper asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Through the window,
Higgs carried a pair of fire extinguishers from the back of the Hummer toward
the visitor’s center.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I believe it’s where
the heating and air conditioning system is located, now,” said Elder
Rindlisbacher, replacing the handkerchief into his pocket.  “Now, brothers and
sisters, we’d like to take you upstairs---oh, and now <i>you</i> have a
question, too?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Where’s the bathroom?”
I heard Lauren ask.  This jerked my attention away from the yellow hummer
outside.  I couldn’t believe Lauren would deign to express any interest in the
Whitmer Home at all, much less ask about a bathroom.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “There weren’t bathrooms
as you know them today, dear.  The Whitmers used an outhouse.  It’s located in
the backyard,” Sister Rindlisbacher clacked, pointing towards the door leading
to the backyard.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No,” said Lauren
unequivocally.  “I mean, where’s the bathroom?  I have to go use it,” she
over-annunciated.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, dear,” said Sister
Rindlisbacher, placing one hand over her heart and another over her mouth. 
“The public restrooms are back next to the entrance of the visitor’s center.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’ll be right back,”
Lauren announced.  She pivoted on the spot and the group parted for her like
the Red Sea for Moses’ scary goth daughter as she proceeded toward the door.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I caught another glimpse
of Higgs entering the visitor’s center with the fire extinguishers and suddenly
realized this could be my chance to make sure no one got to meet up
surreptitiously with Higgs, Jr.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You need me to go with
you, Lauren?” I blurted out.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            It’s worth noting some
specific details about Lauren’s appearance at this point.  She was wearing a
black T-shirt with the words “Sarcasm is My Super Power” on the front.  She had
on a pair of black jeans held up with a belt that I could swear looked like a
length of barbed wire.  As such, Lauren halted with her black-fingernailed hand
on the door handle, then slowly turned around to face me.  The entire tour
group held their collective breaths fearing for their own lives, let alone
mine.  I knew I’d said the wrong thing.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “That’s okay, Dad.  I’m
perfectly able to do this all by myself, now.”  Then she turned, opened the
door, and left.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Wow.  I’d expected lightning
bolts from her eyes to slice me in half or flame to erupt from her fingertips
and envelope me.  I considered that I’d gotten off easy!</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Ahem,” interrupted
Elder Rindlisbacher, shuffling through the space left in the group by Lauren. 
He stopped to stand at the foot of the stairway beside the door Lauren had just
closed behind her.  “Please be careful going up this stairway.  The ceiling is
quite low through here.  People are always hitting their heads.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As the other members of
our group began following Elder Rindlisbacher up the stairs, Megan asked me,
“What was <i>that</i> all about?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Do you think it’s okay
to let Lauren go by herself?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “To the bathroom?” Megan
asked, an incredulous look on her face.  She turned and began to follow the
group up the stairs.  I ducked low under the ceiling of the stairwell to follow
her.  There was a window halfway up the stairwell.  Looking out the front of
the home, I caught sight of Lauren walking up the sidewalk toward the visitor’s
center.  I leaned backwards as my feet kept ascending the narrow staircase in
order to keep sight of her through the window.  Unfortunately, the crowd from
below pressed the rest of me upwards.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As I reached the landing
on the second floor, I realized that it wasn’t what the Higginses were up to
that was most bothersome to me, now.  It was Lauren headed in their direction
that was truly aggravating.  Her possibly getting friendly with Junior was
tantamount to fraternizing with the enemy as far as I was concerned.  I decided
that I would have to keep an eye on things, no matter what the cost.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I scooted to the side of
the landing to let the rest of the tour group file into the small room at the
top of the stairs.  The room itself had a wooden floor with a window looking to
the north.  Unfortunately, this was not the right direction to observe what was
going on outside---the hummer was due east!  The angle of the roof made up the
walls on the east and west sides.  On the side of the room furthest from the
stairs were doorways leading into two dormitory-sized bedrooms.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Go ahead,” I whispered
to those two old ladies, “I’ve seen this before.”  They nodded as they passed
me and finally I was at the back of the group, across the room from Megan and
the others, who were, for the moment, busy watching Elder Rindlisbacher begin
his monologue about the second floor.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Brothers and sisters,
this is a special area of the Whitmer home.  Downstairs was where the
organization of the church took place, but up here on the second floor, just
inside this room on the right---”  Here, Elder Rindlisbacher motioned with his
hand over the rope guarding the way to the small room through the right door. 
“This is where the translation of the Book of Mormon was completed.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As Elder Rindlisbacher
spoke, everyone in the group maneuvered to get a look into the small room where
a little table was laid with First Edition replica Books of Mormon.  During
this fortuitous distraction, I quietly stepped down the staircase a couple
steps toward the landing in the middle where the window looking out toward the
visitor’s center was.  With any luck, I’d be able to see Lauren before she got
through the door.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “One of the stories
associated with this home is that of Sister Mary Whitmer.  Beulah, could you
tell that story, please?” Elder Rindlisbacher continued.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I crept down one more
step.  Two more to go.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “One of Sister Whitmer’s
jobs was milking the cow,” she began.  I took one more step down.  “One morning,
she went out to milk the cow.  She said she was feeling overwhelmed by the
responsibilities she had, taking care of not only her own family, but also
Joseph and Emma as well as Oliver Cowdery.”  I stepped down onto the landing
and quietly ducked down behind the little railing so that I could see out the
window.  “She recounts that, on the way to milk the cow, she met an angel, who
showed her the golden plates.”  At this, there came a few sighs of reverent
amazement from the second floor.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I, however, was busy
looking for Lauren on the sidewalk between the log home we were now in and the
visitor’s center.  To my surprise, I found her, still walking slowly (as they
say, “a little too slowly”) towards the front door.  She was, as I have
described, conspicuously different from all those around her, but clearly above
caring what anyone thought.  I glanced over at the yellow Hummer to see if the
Higginses were there.  They weren’t.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “And that is how we
believe that Sister Whitmer became the second person in this dispensation to
have a view of the golden plates, even before the other witnesses,” Sister
Rindlisbacher concluded.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            But then, as Lauren
approached the front door to the visitor’s center, the worst thing imaginable
happened---out came Junior!  They both halted in their tracks, looking only
slightly surprised to see each other.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Brothers and sisters,
do any of you have any questions?” I heard Elder Rindlisbacher ask the group
above.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I saw Junior move out of
the way of a few other tourists, unlike Lauren, who seemed to command a
sizeable chunk of the sidewalk just by her mere presence.  She and Junior were
talking.  They didn’t seem to be too animated.  I saw Junior point to our van
sitting over under the tree.  Lauren nodded.  Evidently he was saying that he
had seen our van and figured we must be here.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Is there really an
out-house outside?” I heard Piper ask, followed by a few chuckles from the
group.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I could see that Junior
was smiling.  Every now and then, he would run his fingers through his hair. 
As if that made him look cool or something!</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes, it’s just out
back, behind the log home here,” Elder Rindlisbacher answered, a bit of
exasperation in his voice.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Suddenly, Junior pulled
out what looked like a folded up piece of paper.  I knew this couldn’t be
good.  Folded up paper meant that it was a note, and note-passing was just
plain wrong, especially when they should be doing something more sensible, like
messaging each other on their phones.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Are there any other
questions?” Elder Rindlisbacher continued.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Outside, Junior handed
the paper to Lauren.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No!” I exclaimed as I
suddenly stood upright, intent on barreling out the door to intercept the note.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            That’s when I felt
something really, really hard hit my head, and things went extremely dark.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%;page-break-before:always'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><b><span id='Chapter-7'>7</span></b></p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Ooh, that’s going to
hurt.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Is he breathing?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Should we call an
ambulance?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Things were still dark
to me, but through my nausea, I could tell that I was lying on my back with
cold sweat on the back of my neck.  There were low voices around me, but they
seemed distant and unimportant.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Can you get me that
stack of towels, please?  Awesome.  Perfect.  Here, place them under his feet. 
Yeah, just like that.”  It was a familiar voice, but it caused an instinctively
defensive feeling in me for some reason.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Here’s the ice pack you
asked for.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I felt something cold
and wet being pressed up against my forehead.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Is he going to be
alright, Doctor?” I heard the voice of an older man ask.  I think I remembered
the older man’s name being Rindlisbacher.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Does he look like he’ll
need to go to the hospital?”  That was Megan’s voice.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “There, he’s getting
more color in his face.  He should wake up here pretty soon,” said the voice of
the Doctor.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Doctor,” I heard an
older lady say, “You might want to check that young man’s underclothes.  They
might be too tight.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Ah!  Now I knew where
I’d seen the two little old ladies in our tour group, and why they looked so
familiar: they were the pair from the Super Big Mart we’d stopped at on the
previous day.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I opened my eyes and saw
just what I’d dreaded: Dr. Higgins’ face hovering low over mine, watching for
me to wake up.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Rise and shine,
camper!” Higgs greeted me, a little overly loud, I thought.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I started to sit up, but
Higgs pushed me back down with the ice pack he was holding against the top of
my forehead.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Whoa, there, bro!  You
banged your head pretty hard.  Just lay still for a couple minutes,” he said,
taking a look at his expensive watch.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I looked around.  I was
laying on the grass in front of the log home, a circle of strange onlookers
staring at me.  After the quip about the underwear, I checked quickly to make
sure nothing was missing in the clothing department.  Thankfully, it was all
still there.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Will, are you okay?”
Megan asked, kneeling beside me on my other side, opposite from Higgs.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah, I’m fine,” I
grumbled.  My voice sounded thick.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, thank you, Higgs,”
Megan said, reaching out to give Higgs a hug.  And suddenly I found the
inspiration I needed to rise into a sitting position, just in time to interrupt
that gesture.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Where’s Lauren,
anyway?” I asked, taking control of the ice pack from Higgs with my own hand. 
I took it down to take a look at it and immediately heard a collective gasp
from the crowd around me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Ooh, sorry Bro,” Higgs
said, his eyes focused just above my forehead.  “That thing’s pretty big!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I felt with my other
hand and found the large goose egg of a lump just in front of my hairline.  It
was a couple inches in diameter and rose a good half inch away from the
surrounding skin.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, Will.  Does it
hurt?” Megan asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Not too much.  Does it
look pretty bad?” I asked, still probing with my fingertips.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan nodded
apologetically, then turned to Easton.  “Why don’t you go get the other kids
together so we can head back to the hotel.”  Easton nodded and took off.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Normally, I’d just
advise someone to comb their hair over top of it for a few days, but in your
case, Bro...,” Higgs began, before my glare cut him off.  “Maybe a hat will
help?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I returned the ice pack
back to my forehead and I asked Higgs something that had been on my mind, “So,
what are you doing here, anyway?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’m volunteering as the
doctor while I’m up here with the pageant.  One of the things I regularly do is
make sure all the medical supplies at the sites in the area are stocked well
enough to get them through the year.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I rolled my eyes as the
crowd that gathered around us clapped for my great accomplishment of standing
up while still miraculously holding the ice-pack in place.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It’s lucky I was here
when you knocked yourself out, eh, bro?” he said, patting me on my shoulder.  I
resisted the urge to shoot back that if he hadn’t been here in the first place,
I never would have been looking out that window in the stairwell.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah, pretty lucky,” I
mumbled.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Look,” Higgs began, “Is
there anything more I can do to help you guys out?  Seems like you keep running
into bad luck.  First the hotel room and now this.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I closed my eyes to calm
down a little.  On the one hand, he was right.  My perfect vacation plans for
this trip were beginning to unravel.  It seemed as if no matter what we did,
there was always something causing our visits to fly apart, and somehow Higgs
kept galloping in for the rescue.  On the other hand, I didn’t want to have to
use Higgs’ help!</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Mom says we need
plates,” Marianna perked up.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Plates?  What kind of
plates?” Higgs asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Paper plates, like for
a picnic,” Marianna bounced.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It’s okay, Higgs,” I
said.  “We were talking about how we’d forgotten to bring some.  We can get
some at the store---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Don’t do that!  We have
tons of that stuff back at our trailer in Zion’s Camp.  Raylene doesn’t like to
do dishes.”  Really?  Big surprise there.  “So we have a little supply box
right outside the trailer full of stuff like that.  There should be some
silverware, cups, and plates in there.  Just stop by and tell the guard at the
gate that you’re there to visit me.  They’ll give you directions.  Help
yourself.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Suddenly, Easton ran up
and interrupted, “Dad!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Piper’s gone!” he
answered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I heard a sigh from
behind me.  Turning to its source, I saw Elder Rindlisbacher, his handkerchief
in hand, wiping his head again.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “There’s always one
family like this every summer,” he murmured, then turned to shuffle off toward
the visitor’s center.  “But this is the worst I’ve ever seen.  I’ll go make the
announcement.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I looked over at Megan
(she was expressing “Not again!” with her eyes) and then turned to see Marianna
and Easton playing rock-paper-scissors.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What are you two
doing?” I asked them.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Playing
rock-paper-scissors,” Marianna answered quickly, not taking her eyes off of
hers or Easton’s hands.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah, I see that. 
Why?” I resorted to asking.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well, one of us has to
tell you the other thing,” said Marianna.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I suppose the look on my
face, coupled with the bruise, unnerved them, regardless of who had won their
rock-paper-scissors game.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I guess it can wait,”
Easton said quickly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Though I was intensely
curious as to what the “other thing” was, we had to find Piper first.  That was
the most important thing.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As I looked back on this
moment in later years, I became a little smug about our family’s ability to
mobilize so efficiently to find Piper, even in my injured state.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay, meet at five
minute intervals back here.  Megan you stay here.  Marianna, you go north---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Which way is north?”
she interrupted.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “That way!” I pointed. 
“Easton, you go sou---that way.  Lauren, try going west.  I’ll go east to check
the van.”  At this, Lauren smiled weirdly, but nodded at me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “We’ll help, too,” Higgs
volunteered, interrupting my surprise at Lauren’s reaction.  “Want us to check
out the visitor’s center?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I tightened my lips to
keep the boil in my mood under control.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes, that would be
great,” rescued Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We all took off.  I
jogged across the parking lot past the bright yellow illegally parked Hummer,
fighting the urge to kick it, toward our van.  I cupped my hands and leaned my
head toward the space above the driver’s side window.  Piper wasn’t there.  I
scooted backward to the window behind it and did the same thing.  She wasn’t
there, either.  I looked in the grass in front of the van where Angel’s empty
carrier was sitting.  She also wasn’t there.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Then I did a
double-take.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Wait, why was the cat
carrier empty?  Hadn’t we expressly left the cat in the carrier to avoid
trouble?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Not again!” I said out
loud.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I was just about to turn
and head back to the rendezvous point when I saw a folded up piece of paper
resting in the sunlight on Lauren’s seat.  Written across the front of the
little note were the words “To Lauren.”  It had to be from Junior Higgins!</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I turned my pocket
inside out fumbling for my van keys and unlocked the door.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I lunged across the back
seats, but just before my fingers touched the note, I halted.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wait!” I whispered to
myself.  “This is no good.  How could I be so thoughtless?  I can’t do this.” 
I withdrew my hand a couple inches.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “She’d know if I
tampered with it!” I nodded to myself wisely.  I made mental note of the exact
placement and orientation of the little paper rectangle on the seat.  I put my
keys down so that they pointed exactly to where the lower left corner of the
note rested.  Then, ever so gingerly, I lifted the note---just in case it was
booby-trapped.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Scholars seeing the
first fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls couldn’t have held their treasured
finds with more anticipation than I did mine at this moment.  With any luck,
I’d be able to figure out what was going on between Lauren and Junior and head
off any plans that might be in the works.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I held my breath and
slowly prised the folds apart.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What!?!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            On the inside of the
note, written in, of course, black ink:</p>

<p class=Standard align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>“Psych,
Dad!</p>

<p class=Standard align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>Love,
Lauren”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I sat there in my
half-in-half-out position on the back seats with my mouth hanging open.  I was
absolutely astonished about two things: first, that she had lured me in and
almost caught me so blindly; second, that she’d actually written the word
“Love.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hmmm,” I mused, folding
the note back up into its original form.  At least I’d be able to get the note
back into its original place and she’d think I’d never found it.  I placed it
back on the seat in the proper orientation and lined it up with my keys laying
on the seat.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Dad!” Marianna called.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I bumped the back of my
head, probably causing another goose egg to match the one in front, on the roof
of the van and backed out quickly, closing the door behind me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What is it?  Why are
you over here?” I stammered quickly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You said to go north,”
she said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I rolled my eyes. 
“Marianna, I already pointed out that north is that way,” I explained, pointing
in the proper direction again.  “Did you find Piper?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, but I’ll go north
and look!” she said, skipping off in that direction.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            That’s when I heard a
click behind me that, honestly, made me sort of sick.  It was the sound of the van
doors locking automatically after the usual thirty second grace period.  I spun
around and saw my keys still precisely arranged next to the trap-note Lauren
had left for me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I instinctively pulled
on the door handle.  It wouldn’t budge.  I tried reaching over the tops of each
of the cracked windows.  I could only get up to the middle of my forearm. 
Finally, I leaned my forehead (ouch!) and then the top of my head against one of
the windows and thought for a moment.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wait!” I said
suddenly.  “Megan!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I ran back to where
Megan was waiting.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Good,” I thought.  “I’m
the first one back.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You’re back early,”
Megan commented as I skidded to a halt.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Anyone find her, yet?”
I asked, trying to force myself to listen to the answer.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Not that I’ve heard. 
They should be back in a minute or so, though,” she said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Good...good...Can I
borrow your van keys?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “My van keys?  Why?” she
asked, putting her hand slowly into her pocket.  “Don’t you have yours?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I checked in the van to
see if Piper had gone there.”  That part was true.  “She wasn’t.”  That was
also true.  “But I accidentally left my keys in there and it did that automatic
lock thing, again, and locked me out.”  I could find no falsehood in that
statement, either.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan searched through
one pocket, then another.  Then she searched her back pockets.  She swung her
purse around and looked through it.  As my fear mounted, Megan looked up at me
with a scrunched up nose for a few seconds, trying to remember what she’d done
with her keys.  Finally, her expression cleared, she wiped her forehead with
her hand, and said, “Oh!  I remember now.  I gave them to Lauren when she went
to get the camera.  She must still have them.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            All of a sudden, that
sickening feeling I’d felt when I heard the door locks click shut behind me
seemed so much more muted than the sick feeling I now felt.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Did anyone find Piper?”
Easton asked, jogging up to us.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Not yet,” Megan
answered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “She’s not back there,
either,” Lauren announced, causing me to jump slightly, walking up to us from
the direction of the log home with none other than that Junior brat.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Brothers and Sisters,”
came Elder Rindlisbacher’s voice from loudspeakers hidden somewhere in the
bushes, “The little girl that was lost has been found.  She’s here in the
visitor’s center.  I would let Dr. Higgins bring her to you, but she won’t go
unless we have a password.  Please come and pick her up.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan looked visibly
relieved to hear this.  “Come on everyone, let’s go pick up Piper at the lost
and found again.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We hurried off to the
visitor’s center, me scrambling to figure out a way to get Megan’s keys from
Lauren before she could figure out what had happened.  We found Piper in the
missionaries’ office holding Angel on her lap, Higgs and Elder Rindlisbacher
standing off to the side talking.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Piper!  Where did you
go?” Megan gushed, pulling Piper up into a hug.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I just wanted to show
Angel the pictures in the visitor’s center.  He was lonely,” she pouted.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I found her in there
looking at the time capsule with her cat,” Higgs offered.  “She insisted that I
had to bring her to the office.  She’s kind of a stickler for the rules, isn’t
she?  Just like you, Elder McGreg!”  Higgs subscribed to the “spirit of the
law” as opposed to the “letter of the law” on our mission: like parking a
hummer in a no-parking zone just because you’ve got medical supplies!</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Piper, you’ve got to
stop wandering off like that,” I said.  “You might really get lost or hurt
sometime.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan and I shepherded
everyone out the door toward the van.  I realized I was about to fall into
Lauren’s little trap---or, at least, that she would find out that I’d tried to
read a note addressed to her, so to speak.  As we walked, the kids bantered
back and forth about how exciting the afternoon had turned out, what with me
knocking myself out and Piper trying to convert the cat to the gospel.  I kept
thinking, trying to find some way to avoid Lauren finding that I’d tried to pry
into her love life with the enemy.  Finally, something occurred to me.  It
wasn’t something I wanted to do, but, given the current predicament I was in,
it seemed the only option I had left.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hey everyone, should we
let Lauren drive the van around the parking lot?” I asked the family.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            For once, Lauren looked
over at me, her mouth almost half open, and then suddenly closed again.  I
think she recognized that this was my countermove to her initial attack.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wait...what?” Marianna
asked, unable to process what I’d just said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Cool!” Easton said. 
“Do we get helmets?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Will we crash and hurt
Angel?” Piper asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Will!  We can’t do that
here!” Megan gasped.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Why not?  All good church
members learn to drive in a church parking lot.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “But this is a visitor’s
center parking lot!” Megan said.  “And there are lots of cars and people
around.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Actually, it’s an
honest-to-goodness church building,” I continued.  “It’s just a little fancier
than most.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah.  It even has a
gym,” Easton contributed.  I wondered if I should ask how he knew that, but
decided I had a more pressing issue I was dealing with right then.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “And there’s a parking
lot to the north!” Marianna chimed in.  “That is north, right?” she asked,
pointing in the right direction for once.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay, then it’s
settled.  Lauren, you still have the keys, right?” I asked, settling into my
ruse more comfortably.  I only had one thing left to do in order to accomplish
my design.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Lauren looked at me and
squinted warily, trying to figure out what was going on.  She knew something
was up, but couldn’t quite tell what it was, yet.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “She’s on to me,” I
thought to myself.  “But if I move quickly enough, she won’t be able to counter
this move.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Lauren nodded slowly and
pulled Megan’s keys out of her pocket.  Still looking at me, she headed for the
driver’s side door.  With a quick move, I grabbed Megan’s hand and nudged her
on ahead, whispering to her as she passed me, “You sit beside her.  She’ll be
less nervous that way.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Lauren clicked the van
doors unlocked.  I chanced a quick glance down at the seat where my keys still
lay beside the “To Lauren” note.  As fast as I could, bumping Megan out of the
way, I opened the door behind Megan’s and grabbed my keys before Lauren could
see them.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, look!” I announced
loudly.  “It’s a note for Lauren.  Here you go, Lauren,” I said, handing it
over the seat to where she’d just sat down on the driver’s side, her door not
yet closed.  She looked from the note to me, then back to the note, and
smiled.  She’d figured it out, but she couldn’t prove anything.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Will, are you sure
about this?  Maybe we shouldn’t do this here today.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well, if you say so---”
I began, feeling maybe I’d gotten my cake and was now going to be able to eat
it, too.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Nope.  It’ll be fine,”
Lauren said, shutting the driver’s side door, jamming Megan’s key into the
ignition, and starting the van much too adeptly for my taste.  She clicked her
seatbelt in and adjusted the rear-view mirror till I could see her mischievous
grin.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wait, should we pray
first?” Marianna asked.  Easton laughed at this.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Here’s what we’re going
to do,” I began, fastening my own seatbelt.  I could hear Piper in the row of
seats behind me forcing Angel back into the pet carrier he so loved to be in. 
“First, shift into reverse, then let your foot off the brake and let the van
idle itself back.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Cool!” Lauren quipped. 
Everyone looked behind us to see what poor soul was going to meet their maker
in the next few seconds.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As if she’d practiced
this for years, Lauren backed the van effortlessly out of the space until it
was aligned to make the turn forward toward the parking lot to the north.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wow!” I whispered. 
Lauren raised an eye-brow at me in the rear-view mirror and shifted into drive
without even looking at what she was doing.  She gracefully turned the van into
the back parking lot entrance and continued past the church building to the
larger, empty parking area behind it.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Um, okay then.  Let’s
do a few loops around the parking lot, now,” I gulped.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “We’re gonna die, we’re
gonna die, we’re gonna die,” Marianna repeated over and over, her eyes covered
with both hands.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So, did everyone have
fun visiting the sites today?” Megan asked while we slowly looped around the
empty back parking lot.  This was met with a few mumbles of disinterest.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What’s wrong, guys? 
Didn’t you like seeing the places we went today?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            After several seconds,
Easton finally broke the silence.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “They were okay,” he
said.  “But is this all we’re going to do here?  Go see sites?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well, yeah, mostly. 
But in two days we’re going to the temple, and then to see the pageant,” I
answered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            This statement was met
with a resounding silence as we started another loop around the parking lot. 
Lauren seemed quite at home in the driver’s seat.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Let me ask this, then. 
What would you guys like to do?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hyrum asked if we were
here to be in the pageant, too,” said Lauren.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Who’s Hyrum?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Junior,” answered Megan
quickly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Oh.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Can we be in the
pageant, Dad?” asked Marianna in the only way she knew how to ask: excited.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah!  That would be
fun!” said Piper from behind me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I could get into that,”
agreed Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan looked at me with
some concern.  “I think that’s just not possible at this point, kids.  I’m sure
your Dad would like to be able to make that happen, but it’s probably not
something he can do at this point.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I sighed.  I wished that
there were some way that I could have enough clout to get us into the pageant. 
Even if we were just part of one of the big crowd scenes, that would really
make the trip memorable for the kids.  But, it was probably a safe bet that
there was no possible way, not a snowball’s chance in heck, for me to get us
into the pageant in any way, shape or form at that late date.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I bet Hyrum’s dad could
get us in,” said Lauren, starting up our third loop.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            That did it.  Even
though I knew I shouldn’t take the bait, that I shouldn’t commit to something
so impossible and let the family down....</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Everyone be ready,” I
said.  “I’ll get us in.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Even my eyes got wide. 
What had I just said!?!  Did I really just tell the kids I not only <i>could</i>,
but <i>would</i> get them all into the pageant?  In two days?  Oh no!  Why did
I say that?  Because I’d allowed my pride to get the best of me.  That’s why. 
And now what was I going to do in order to not let them down?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And then I remembered
Tim back at the ice cream shack, and his story about the Gadianton Band....</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Lauren turned again for
what I thought would be a fourth loop, when she started slowing.  She came to a
stop and shifted into park.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What did you stop for?”
I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The police officer,”
she answered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The what?” cried Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I snapped my head around
to look behind us.  There was an unmarked, white car behind us with flashing
orange lights on the dashboard.  A tall man in sunglasses and a dark suit was
just getting out of the car with a clipboard.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh no!  Now we’re going
to jail!” bawled Marianna.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Angel doesn’t like
jail!” Piper whimpered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Nobody’s going to jail,
do you understand, Marianna?  No one.  Okay?” I reassured her.  The officer
passed by Marianna’s window, causing her to shudder.  “Lauren, just roll the
window down for him,” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Lauren touched the
button and the window went down.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Afternoon, ma’am.  I’m
with Church security services.  We just wondered what you were doing here.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Lauren calmly looked
into the face of the security guy.  “I’m helping my Dad’s gambit move by
practicing loops in this empty parking lot.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The officer tried to
keep up with Lauren’s vocabulary: “Well, we don’t allow gambling on Church
property.  In fact, our policy is to uphold local, state and federal laws on
Church property, which includes operation of motor vehicles.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I decided to follow the
nice officer’s line of argument a little further at this point.  “Does that
include parking?  Because there’s a big yellow Hummer out front parked up on
the sidewalk.”  Would I be happy if they towed it away?  Would Higgs be getting
just desserts?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As it turned out, it
wasn’t even a possibility.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “That’s different,” said
the officer.  “That’s Dr. Higgins.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The following day, at
the conclusion of our next church historical site visit, I found myself in the
main foyer of the E. B. Grandin building, one of the hallmarks of church
history, the place where the Book of Mormon was first published, and I was
watching a flying, frenzied, feline ball of fur yowl its way around the room in
front of dozens of onlookers I’d gotten to meet throughout the morning at one
mishap after another.  The amazing thing was, I was not only laughing, I was
absolutely jubilant!</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Perhaps I should back up
and explain what led to this unexpected reaction.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I had started out the
morning in our (or Higgs’, rather) hotel room by sneaking into a closet off the
hallway leading from the master suite to the living room.  Inside, I smoothed
out the wrinkled piece of paper I’d gotten from Tim and then written my own notes
on the night before.  I had gone to the hotel’s business center and done some
Internet research on the Gadianton Band at the Hill Cumorah pageant and the
supposed “Gadianton the Great.”  Several amusingly shady websites later, and
after an Internet chat with the oft-forgotten Fourth Nephite, I obtained a
phone number for “Gadianton the Great.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I dialed the number and
started counting rings.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hello?” answered the
voice on the other end after the fourth ring.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hi, is this...” I
checked my paper quickly, “Gadianton the Great?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Who wants to know?”
sneered the voice on the other end.  It sounded like a teenage boy lowering his
voice to me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Tim?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah---er, I mean…who?”
the voice asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well, I’m looking for
someone who can get us...me and my family that is...a spot in a crowd scene at
the pageant,” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “When?” asked Gadianton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Tomorrow night,” I
answered.  Gadianton laughed condescendingly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It’ll cost you.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I pulled the phone away
from my head and stared at it.  Was this really happening?  This sounded like
something off of a bad, late night mafia movie or something.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What do you mean?” I
asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “How many packages?”
asked Gadianton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Packages?” I asked
back.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “People, dude, people! 
Gosh, you’re such a Zoramite.  How many people?” he asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Um, six. 
Six...packages...in all.”  Should I maybe have mentioned a cat, too?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I waited for a moment,
but the line was silent.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hello?” I said again.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Gadianton came back on. 
“I need something from you in return.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Like what?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Gadianton cleared his
throat and answered.  “I know about you.  You have a ring, a CTR ring.  With a
red circle background, right?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah, it was a gift
from my kids.  They probably got it from somewhere on the Internet, so it might
not be, you know, official Church---” I started to explain.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I know what it is.  It’s
a 1969 prototype CTR ring.  There were only fifteen of them made.  For the
First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve.  Only five were known to still
exist.  Until today.  Yours is the sixth.  I want that CTR ring.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “My CTR ring?!?” I
exclaimed.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Leave it in a sealed
plastic bag in the men’s restroom behind the Hill Cumorah visitor’s center. 
Second stall from the right, behind the bowl.  If it’s not there by five
o’clock tomorrow evening, the deal’s off!”  And then Gadianton the Great hung
up.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I exited the closet much
to the surprise of two of the waiters who had just entered from the front
door.  I held my finger up to my mouth to tell them to keep quiet, then headed
on toward the kitchen.  As I passed Lauren, who was lying on the couch in the
center court of the suite, her head buried in the book with the vampire jacket
again, I noticed that breakfast was pretty much a paltry affair again.  There
was another assortment of nine or ten cold cereal boxes, a heaping stack of
toast that had steamed up the domed glass covering it, a huge vat of scrambled
eggs, three miles of bacon, and an array of pineapples and citrus (with some
strawberries and blueberries) surrounding a centerpiece watermelon carved into
the shape of a basket holding mounds and mounds of melon balls (watermelon,
cantaloupe, and honey-dew).</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I sat down to join the
rest of the family who had already started without me.  My thoughts were still
on my conversation with Gadianton.  My CTR ring.  The one the kids had given
me.  I wasn’t sure how I felt about that.  On the one hand, it evidently held
some sort of value to a church history buff somewhere.  But it also represented
a bond between my children and me.  But wouldn’t it be worth sacrificing the
ring for the chance to get us all killed in the pageant?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It was better stocked
than Super Big-Mart!” Marianna was saying.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I reached for the
toast.  Megan pulled the cover off so I could grab a couple pieces.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Thanks, Megan.  What
was better stocked than Super Big-Mart?” I asked in Marianna’s direction,
plopping the toast onto my shiny white plate and removing the shiny sterling
silver ring from the heavy linen napkin.  “Lauren!” I called into the other
room.  “Can you come in and eat with us.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The building outside of
the Higgins’ trailer that we went to last night,” Easton answered through a
mouthful of several pieces of bacon.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Don’t talk with your
mouth full,” Megan chewed at him through a muffin (blueberry, from the looks of
it).</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Why are you guys going
on about that box?  It was just a bunch of paper plates,” I said, searching
through the lettuce piled around the watermelon basket to find a miniature jar
of jam in a flavor I liked.  I settled on marmalade, although strawberry was a
close contender.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You call those plates
‘paper?’” Lauren asked, sliding into her seat and reaching for the spoon in the
scrambled eggs.  I took notice that her vampire book was sitting on the side of
the couch several feet away.  That, I thought, was another sign of
progress---that she would willingly sit down and interact with us.  “Those
plates were practically dishwasher-safe.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “And they even had fancy
paper towels,” said Piper, chewing on a gooey toasted pastry of some kind.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You just think those
paper towels were fancy because they had pictures of cats on them,” I said,
just before I took my first bite of toast.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No,” Piper answered
seriously.  “Those were the napkins.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I thought the
tablecloths had the kitty print on them,” Megan said, picking at her omelet.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I swallowed.  “You know
what?  If we hadn’t all been crowding each other so much looking into that box,
maybe we would be able to remember things a little better.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You mean like that it
wasn’t a box, it was a walk-in shed, Dad?” said Lauren.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “And,” I continued
unabated, “if you all hadn’t been so loud, then maybe that security guy
wouldn’t have come over.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You mean Officer Duke?”
Marianna asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I mean the crazy
wannabe SWAT guy who came over brandishing his guns, demanding to know what we
were doing there,” I finished, punctuating my statement with another bite of
toast.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, stop exaggerating!”
said Megan.  “He had a radio, <i>not</i> guns.  And the only one yelling was
you, complaining about how there were too many costume supplies in the shed to
sort through in order find any plates.  Plates which Higgs was giving us for
free, Will.  And let’s not even talk about who was scoping out the Higgins’
trailer to see how nice it was.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Look,” I said, dropping
my silver butter knife onto my china service for added effect, “calling that
ostentatious monstrosity a ‘trailer’ is like calling Buckingham Palace a shack! 
And besides, I was checking to make sure that we wouldn’t wake anyone up who
might be sleeping.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “At 7:30 in the
evening?” Lauren asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It doesn’t matter,
anyway.  The Higginses weren’t there,” I defended, choosing a little jar of
strawberry preserves over grape jelly for my second piece of toast.  “Probably
off at a hoity-toity dinner party or something,” I mumbled.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You were pretty funny,
though, Dad!” Piper laughed through a mouthful of yogurt.  Apparently, while
I’d been down researching Gadianton’s Band yesterday evening, the kids had been
laughing about the episode between me and Officer Duke till late into the
night.  In fact, Marianna and Easton must have put together a script and
learned it by heart, because they began performing a marvelously
over-dramatized re-enactment of the scene right there at the table across from
me:</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “<i>Excuse me, sir,”</i>
Easton said in his low, menacing, Officer Duke security-guard voice.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “<i>Who, me?”</i>
Marianna answered in what I assume was supposed to be an impression of me.  She
had pulled her hair back as far as she could above her forehead, presumably to
mimic my receding hair line, enhancing the resemblance to me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “<i>Yes, sir.  Are you
supposed to be here in Zion’s Camp?”</i> Easton’s Officer Duke voice inquired.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “<i>Technically, no, but
we have an invitation,”</i> explained the Marianna version of me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “<i>From who?”</i> said
Easton’s security guard voice again.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “<i>Whom</i>,” I had
corrected.  It’s true.  I was a stickler for the objective case.  “<i>That
depends.  Whom am I talking to, anyway?”</i> Marianna-Dad asked with much more
dramatized defiance than I thought was warranted.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “<i>I’m Officer Duke
with Church site security services,”</i> said Easton’s Officer Duke voice.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “<i>How do we know
you’re really a security guard?” </i>Marianna’s version of me asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “<i>Base, this is Duke,</i>”
spoke Easton into an imaginary radio microphone on his shoulder.<i>  “I may
need some backup at the Doctor’s place.”</i></p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “<i>Geesh!  You know
Higgs, too?!?”</i> Marianna’s mimicked Dad voice yelled with mock exasperation.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “<i>Oh, so you </i>do<i>
know Dr. Higgins?”</i> Easton’s Officer Duke voice asked, picking up on my
knowledge of Higgs’ nickname.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Piper joined in with her
high ‘Mom’ voice, batting her eyes.  “<i>Oh, they were missionary companions.”</i></p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “<i>Oh!” </i>said
Easton, the guard, grabbing his heart with one hand and kneeling down beside
his breakfast chair with wide, reverent eyes.  “<i>So you’re in the Second
Quorum of the Seventy?”</i> Easton’s Officer Duke voice said, and then added
quietly aside to his imaginary mic, “<i>Cancel the backup, base.”</i></p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “<i>No, I am not a
‘nobody’ general authority!”</i> Marianna scoffed in her Dad voice.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “<i>The assistant to the
Twelve, then?”</i> Easton said in hushed tones, his security guard eyes growing
wider, and kneeling even lower to the ground.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “<i>What’s your badge
number, anyway?”</i> demanded Marianna.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            At this, I put the rest
of my toast in my mouth and protested, “Wait just a minute, now.  I did <i>not</i>
ask what his badge number was!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, yeah.  Sorry, Dad,”
Marianna said quickly out-of-character.  Then she turned back to Easton, pulled
her hair a little tighter above her eyes, and demanded, “<i>Let me talk to your
supervisor!”</i></p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I rolled my eyes.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Or maybe it was, ‘<i>I’m
calling the Church Office Building to check on you,</i>’” Marianna wondered
aloud.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan interrupted the
fun.  “Okay everyone, we need to hurry and finish.  We need to get started if
we want to make it to all these places today.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Where <i>are</i> we
going today, anyway?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Marianna straightened up
in her white-linen-covered chair, pulled out her pink and purple book with the
green-feathered pen, and cleared her throat.  “According to the schedule,” she
began, “today we are going to visit the E. B. Grandin Building, where the Book
of Mormon was first published; then the Sacred Grove; then, if there’s time
left over, we can go see the Hill Cumorah.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hill Cumorah?  Cool!”
Easton blurted out, halting the steady flow of pancakes into his mouth and
rising abruptly from the table to run into his room, all of us staring after
him for several seconds.  What had that been all about?  I’d have to watch him
a little closer throughout the day.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hey,” I said, finally
breaking our collective fascination with Easton’s sudden disappearance, “What
if we rearranged things and went to the Sacred Grove first.  You know, so we
can see it in the morning like Joseph Smith did.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            A sharp klink of a fork
on a plate was followed by a quick, “No!” from Lauren.  The rest of us shifted
our wide-eyes now to Lauren.  Lauren picked her fork back up and stirred
nervously at her scrambled eggs.  “We should, you know, stick with the plan we
made.”  She bit her bottom lip, rose and left the table quickly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What was that all
about?” I asked.  Piper and Marianna shrugged.  I wondered if it had anything
to do with the note I’d seen Junior give to Lauren the day before.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Remembering the miles
we’d put on the van the previous day, I asked, “So, Marianna, how far away are
these sites?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Marianna smiled and
answered, “I don’t know.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            With breakfast over, the
next phase of the morning began with another visit to the front desk to get
directions to the places we would be visiting.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Good morning, Leroy,” I
said brightly when I arrived in the lobby.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Good morning, Mr. Not-Higgins,”
Carrie-Willow greeted me without taking her eyes off the screen in front of
her.  “I chose this one this morning,” she said, absentmindedly pointing to the
“Leroy” name-tag she was wearing and smiling, “just for you!”  She punched a
few keys and the glow of the monitor on her face changed the colors being
reflected off her blue hair.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Thanks!  How
flattering,” I said, waiting for her to shift her attention from the computer
screen to me.  I lowered my head slightly in order to put my face closer to her
line of sight, hoping that would give her the hint that I had something to talk
to her about, but to no avail.  She still didn’t move her eyes from the screen
in front of her, but did blow a strand of her blue hair out of her eyes as she
typed in furious spurts on her keyboard.  I waited a little more for her to
finish and look up at me.  She punched at keys and blew more at the hair in her
eyes.  Her eyes would dart back and forth across the screen for a couple
seconds, then she would bite her lower lip and abuse another few keys.  A
couple minutes later, I decided I’d better check to see if she’d forgotten
about me...standing two feet in front of her.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Um, Carrie?  You seem a
little preoccupied.  Is something wrong?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            She froze, moved only
her eyes to me, then answered, “Yes.”  Then she went back to playing
whack-a-key.  After several rounds in which I surmised that the keyboard must
be winning, she picked up a pencil and scribbled something on a sticky note. 
Then she began jabbing at more keys with the eraser-side of the pencil.  I
figured it was time for me to intervene again, if only for the sake of the
keyboard.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So, Carrie.  Why do you
smite your keyboard with a pencil?”  I figured the allusion to this saying from
the part in the Book of Mormon where the angel chastised Laman and Lemuel for
beating Sam and Nephi with a rod was lost on her, but hopefully it would seem a
little light-hearted.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Carrie-Willow’s
shoulders relaxed and she finally turned her attention to me.  “I’m sorry.  Yesterday,
Jill from the afternoon shift promised a family that we would have a room ready
for them this morning.  I usually have one I keep in reserve, but it was water
damaged a couple days ago.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I nodded.  I remembered
hearing something about it at 2:30 AM the previous day.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “But,” she continued,
“even though the water line is fixed, now, apparently Bob and the water guys
haven’t been able to get the room completely cleaned up, yet.  The family was
just here and I had to tell them it wouldn’t be ready for, like, another day or
two.  They looked so sad.  So, I was checking to see if anyone else in the area
had a room open.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I have to admit that
Carrie-Willow had just surprised and impressed me.  I had made my judgment of
her based solely on blue hair and puppy-dog maps.  I was suddenly grateful that
I’d been prevailed upon by my family to help the Garr family, who just two days
prior had been in this same predicament.  It softened my heart.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Did you find anything?”
I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No.  Nothing closer
than Syracuse.”  She blew some more blue hair out of her eyes again, then
turned her full attention to me.  “What can I do for you, Mr. Not-Higgs?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I felt a little guilty
changing the subject to my own needs, but went ahead and asked for directions
to the E. B. Grandin Building, the Sacred Grove, and the Hill Cumorah. 
Carrie-Willow didn’t have to draw a map this time, because apparently the hotel
was stocked with a supply of pre-printed maps today.  I walked back to the
elevator pretending to look at the map.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            In reality, though, a
thought had just occurred to me.  I glanced back toward Carrie-Willow’s desk. 
She had the phone receiver wedged between her head and shoulder as she typed on
her keyboard.  Looking back at the pre-printed map I was holding, I focused on the
words “Book of Mormon” next to the iconic picture of the E. B. Grandin
building, then chanced another quick glance back at Carrie-Willow.  One of the
things I’d thought about accomplishing during this vacation was to give a Book
of Mormon to someone, even if it were only a “check the box” kind of
give-away.  But given Carrie-Willow’s violence (at least toward the poor
keyboard) in her drive to help out someone in need, maybe she might be a good
person to give a Book of Mormon to.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Fifteen minutes and several
cat scratches later, we arrived at the quickly filling parking lot of the
Grandin Building.  Parking ushers in fluorescent yellow vests pointed and
motioned us through the maze of cones and yellow caution tape into parking
spots just wide enough for our spirits to get out of, but hardly anything
else.  And this is where the fun started.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Dad, what do we do with
Angel today?” Piper asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Same as yesterday,
Piper.  Put Angel’s carrier by the van so he can wait for us here, but this
time, no coming back and taking him out,” Megan answered.  Megan had added what
I had been thinking, so I nodded appreciatively to her as I slithered out the
driver’s side door.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Where do we go?” I
heard Easton ask as I slithered my way back to meet everyone behind the van.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’d say over there,”
Lauren said, pointing to a large, blue tented area at one end of the parking
lot.  It was one of those reception tents with only a roof.  Rows of standard,
Church-issue meetinghouse chairs were arranged under it.  Mounted on top of the
tent was a large sign that read, “Enter here for tours of the E. B. Grandin
Building --- Site of the first publication of the Book of Mormon.”  More of the
same plastic caution tape created a winding maze up to the last row of chairs
under the tent for people to be admitted to the building in manageable groups.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Now, it might be
imagined that the thoughts that went through my head as we crossed the parking
lot to the tent were about what types of mayhem were about to ensue, given our
experiences of the previous day.  What would happen today?  Would the cat get
stuck in an air-conditioning vent somewhere and the fire department called
out?  Would one of the kids knock something priceless off its super-secure
mounting points?  Would Officer Duke be there to follow us the entire time? 
These were questions going through my head as we all filed into the plastic
tape maze and began playing musical chairs with the other guests, waiting for
our turn to be ushered into the building.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Relax,” Megan whispered
to me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What?” I asked,
pretending that I hadn’t just abruptly halted tapping my feet nervously.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Everything will be
fine.  Just enjoy the tour,” she said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I took a deep breath to
clear my head and answered, “Okay, I’ll try.”  I took a look around to size up
just who we would be offending today---otherwise known as our tour group.  We
seemed to be in the middle of a large group of purple T-shirts.  Off to our
left was a middle-aged guy wearing a yellow visor eating m&amp;m’s and laughing
at a joke he was telling to the purple T-shirted people in the seats in front
of him.  There was a small boy swimming in a purple T-shirt fidgeting around in
those seats who apparently was named “Tony,” judging from the number of times I
heard “Tony stop bouncing, please.”  A group of young men and women ahead of
them, all wearing the same purple T-shirts, appeared to be a youth group, all
of them with digital cameras and cell phones clicking and flashing.  One of the
older purple-shirted youth had a missionary name tag on his chest.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As I panned backwards, I
had to do a double take on my own kids.  They were just...sitting there.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What’s wrong?” Megan
asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Huh?  Oh, nothing, I
guess,” I whispered back to her.  “But our kids are acting pretty
suspiciously.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            She peered around me and
looked down the row, then back to me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yep, looks bad.  Maybe
they’re plotting to steal m&amp;m’s,”  she said, laughing at me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Go ahead and laugh it
up, but this is the calm before the storm.  You just watch.  I just know---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Precisely as I was about
to tell Megan that I knew better and that something was definitely about to
happen, something happened!  I suddenly saw nothing but blue and felt the
weight of the tent canvas pressing down on the bruise on my forehead.  The tent
had suddenly dropped to top-of-chair level, prompting screams and shouts from
all around us.  The air was thick with “Oh my hecks!” and “Goshes,” and I heard
m&amp;m’s spill onto a metal chair.  The fact that something <i>had</i>
happened didn’t surprise me; however, the fact that it had happened so quickly
after our arrival <i>did</i>.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Dad!” I heard Piper
shout from somewhere to my left as I struggled to turn around and kneel in
front of my chair to get my head out of the tent fabric.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Alright, who did it?” I
called out calmly.  “Easton, was it you?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, Dad,” Easton
answered from three chairs down.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Will!  Stop it!  Lauren
and Marianna, are you two okay?” Megan asked.  She had managed to get herself
onto the ground, as well, and I could see her blue-tinted face scowling at me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “We’re fine,” Marianna
called, raising a bit of the tent roof with her arm from just beyond Piper’s
seat.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            This was interesting to
me.  If all of my children were right here next to me and, amazingly, seemed
not to have caused this calamity, there was only one thing left for me to
believe.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Where’s the cat?” I
asked hastily.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Brothers and Sisters,
please remain calm.  It appears that my husband, Elder Hertburg, has discovered
how to cause a malfunction with the tent!” came the crackly voice of an older
lady near the back of the tent.  Megan looked over and raised an eyebrow at me,
as if I’d recklessly rushed to attribute this to our kids too quickly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Can you blame me?” I
shrugged.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            After crawling our way
through the chair rows, crushing several m&amp;m’s in the process, we finally
made it into the Grandin Building where we were joined with the group of people
who were just being herded into the front room of the building for the tour.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Through many years of
training, I have learned to tactically observe my surroundings when I step foot
into a new location with my children.  While most people might have thought the
scene to our right depicting block and tackle to raise and lower wooden pallets
as interesting and rustic, the only thing that occurred to me was the possibility
for abuse by my kids as a neat-o elevator for Piper.  Most people probably
thought the faux stone wall behind the block and tackle a lovely representation
of early nineteenth century building styles.  Me?  I could visualize my son
rock climbing.  Worst of all, a first edition Book of Mormon under a
hermetically sealed glass case might be the object of reverence and awe to
most, but to me, I was thinking Officer Duke might need to be here to
personally keep it safe from accidental damage!</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Brothers and Sisters,”
came the crackly old lady’s stern voice again, startling me out of my intelligence
gathering, “I’m Sister Hertburg.  Follow me into the front room where the tour
will begin.  You there!  You’ll have to put that candy away!” she barked at the
guy with the yellow visor eating m&amp;m’s.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wow, a little pushy for
a senior missionary, isn’t she?” Megan whispered, then she took Piper’s hand
and followed the crackly-voiced lady toward the front of the building.  I say
the “front” of the building because we had actually entered through the back
door, from the parking lot.  I held back a little to make sure I could keep all
the kids in sight.  Easton seemed to be sizing up the block and tackle,
Marianna was skipping after Megan and Piper.  Lauren, however, was turning in
slow circles as she walked with the flow of the crowd toward the front room,
scanning faces as she turned.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Welcome to the E. B.
Grandin building, Brothers and Sisters,” Sister Hertburg was saying as I
trailed into the front room.  She was standing in front of a counter which ran
across the whole side of the room.  Sister Hertburg, I have to admit, made me
shudder a little.  She reminded me of my second-grade teacher, with curly
silver hair, beady black eyes, wearing a light-blue sweater and a polyester
skirt.  More than anything else, though, she seemed to have the same talent as
my second-grade teacher of commanding with a look.  It wouldn’t surprise me if
she had knitted that sweater herself by just leering real hard at a pair of
knitting needles.  The room quickly became silent as she bathed the room in the
wash of a look that clearly said, “Get quiet!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As for the rest of this
entrance room, there were shelves (good for climbing) lining both side walls,
loaded with hundreds of antique-looking books (could be turned upside down on
the shelves), some bound in leather, such as several Bibles and, of course,
first edition replicas of the Book of Mormon.  There were other books bound
only in paper (perfect for drawing humorous doodles on).  Finally, a black
pot-bellied stove squatted stubbornly in the center of the room (maybe a small
animal could be stuffed in there.  Come to think of it, that was maybe not such
a bad idea!).</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Easton looked at me,
pointed at the stove and whispered, “That’d be a perfect place for a geo-cache,
wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Um...no,” I answered,
smiling, but making clear that he was not to open it, take anything out of it,
deposit anything into it, or anything like unto all those actions.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So what are you purple
people, anyway?  A ward mutual group or something?” asked Sister Hertberg,
looking at the group wearing purple T-shirts.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The purple shirted folks
all turned to look at the boy with the missionary name-tag on his chest, who,
in turn, looked nervously up at the yellow-visored guy.  He was apparently
their leader.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I believe this is more
of a family reunion,” the yellow-visored guy explained.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Is that so?” Sister
Hertburg asked suspiciously.  “Alrighty, then.”  She then started pacing back
and forth in front of the wooden counter with her hands joined behind her back,
like a general briefing her troops.  “If you look around, you’ll see lots of
books here.  That’s because E. B. Grandin was a prominent book publisher in
Palmyra during Joseph Smith’s time.  People came here to buy books.  Any
questions?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well, I’ve got to hand
it to her: she gets right to the point,” whispered Megan.  I ducked a little
lower.  I didn’t want to get caught by Sister Hertburg associating with a
talker during her presentation.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Nobody has any
questions?” cracked Sister Hertburg.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Being at the rear of the
group, I watched as people in our group held up tentative hands to ask Sister
Hertburg questions about objects in the room.  One person asked about the
gameboard on the wall, someone else about whether E. B. Grandin was a member of
the Church (he wasn’t).</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As for our kids, Lauren
was looking at the time on her phone regularly and peering out the windows and
doors.  Marianna was whispering the answers for all the group’s questions to
Megan, who was nodding patiently.  Easton was looking suspiciously at the books
on the shelf while Piper was sitting on one of the corner chairs.  My
attention, however, was suddenly drawn to the boy named Tony, the one in the
too-large purple T-shirt.  He looked half Easton’s age, and had slowly crept
behind the black pot-bellied stove.  He was in the process of pulling and
turning on its handles and screws.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Young man, what are you
doing?” asked Sister Hertburg, firing a salvo of “Don’t mess with me!” looks
with her eyes at the boy behind the stove.  The boy immediately retreated from
the stove.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Tony!  Let’s not bother
the stove,” one of the ladies in the group scolded him, grabbing his hand.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Please don’t touch any
of the exhibits!” commanded Sister Hertburg.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Now, Gertrude, let’s
not scare away our visitors,” a diminutive older man said cheerfully, entering
the room from behind us.  He threaded his way through the group and stood
beside Sister Hertberg.  “Brothers and Sisters, if you’ll follow me, we’ll now
go into Mr. Grandin’s business office.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As Elder and Sister
Hertburg led the way through the door, Piper tugged on my arm.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Dad!” she said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What is it, Piper?” I
asked as the group filed out of the entrance room and into the next, which
looked like an office (lots and lots of drawers---good for depositing gum!).</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I have to go to the
bathroom!” she said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I eyed her suspiciously,
then looked for the other three kids to see if they had sent her to do this as
a diversion.  Marianna and Easton had already made it into the next room. 
Lauren was behind Megan looking out the front windows as she moved into the
next room.  Megan looked back at me with a questioning look.  I decided that
this wasn’t a plot.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Bathroom,” I mouthed,
pointing to Piper.  Megan nodded and I directed Piper by her shoulders back to
the entrance we’d come through.  I figured I might as well take the
opportunity, too, so I said to Piper right before we arrived at the restroom
doors, “Okay, Piper, I’ll meet you back here when you’re finished.  If you get
here first, just wait for me, okay?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Piper nodded and
disappeared through the women’s bathroom door.  I went into the men’s restroom,
sized it up, and found the stall I wanted.  And there I was, sitting, trying to
mind my own business in my newly adopted stall, when suddenly, I heard
footsteps approaching the bathroom from outside.  Being a man who prefers
solitude in my communes with nature, I gritted my teeth and resigned myself to
sharing the bathroom with a complete stranger.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The outer bathroom door
opened, and, of the five stalls available, the stranger, for some unknown
reason, decided to pick the stall right next to mine.  I called foul on this
play.  This clearly violated long-standing man-code which requires the
selection of a stall furthest away from all others currently in use.  Everyone
knows that, right?  Instinctively, I pulled my feet in a little closer to the
center of my stall to avoid any sharing of personal space.  My new next-stall
neighbor did a little turn-around-and-close-the-door shuffle and made himself
at home, so to speak.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And then there was
silence.  It was very uncomfortable.  I could hear the ticking of a watch
reverberating off the hard, ceramic-tile walls.  I could hear muffled voices
from outside and the slight buzz of the fluorescent lights overhead.  I was
starting to become aware of the sound of my own heartbeat.  Really, whoever
designed this bathroom should have put in some loud fans to make noise. 
Suddenly, the silence was broken by the guy in the stall next to me:</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Those sure are some
nice shoes!” he said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            <i>What!?!</i>  Three
things are worthy of note here: First of all, these were the shoes I got at
Super-Big Mart, so they weren’t that great.  Second, who says <i>anything</i>
to the person in the stall next to them, let alone something like <i>that</i>? 
Another clear violation of well-known man-code.  And finally, third, I knew
that voice!</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Higgs?!?” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Elder McGreg?  Is that
you, bro?” said Higgs.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What are you doing
here?” I spluttered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Dude!  I had to use
the---” he started.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No!  Not in <i>here</i>
here!  In the Grandin Building?” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh!  Well, you see,
Junior made us switch our schedule around to come here first today---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Just then, the intercom
system throughout the building crackled to life.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Brothers and Sisters,
we have a lost child.  Her name is ‘Piper.’  Would her parents please come to
the entrance desk to pick her up.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Bro, didn’t she get
lost yesterday, too?” Higgs asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Really?” I asked,
looking upward.  “Yes, I have to go!” I said, still shocked that I was carrying
on a conversation with Higgs as he sat in the bathroom stall next to me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I heard Higgs call,
“Bye!” as I exited through the outer restroom door.  It was then that I bonked
Piper to the ground---that is, <i>my</i> Piper.  I looked over toward the
entrance desk, where another sad looking little girl was sitting on a chair
with legs swinging back and forth.  She was sitting next to Junior Higgins,
holding his hand.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Great!  He’s good with
kids, too,” I murmured to myself, angry to acknowledge positive aspects in my
enemies.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I looked back at my
Piper, who was lifting herself back onto her hands and knees.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Are you lost?” I asked
her.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Uh, Dad?  How could I
be lost if you’re here with me?” she answered, rubbing a spot on the back of
her head.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Bro!” Higgs cried,
bursting from the door behind me, bumping me in the back of the head as I’d
just done to Piper, and then pulling me up into an involuntary man-hug.  “Looks
like you found her!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “How is it that I keep
running into you?” I asked, pushing away from him and backing away to stand by
Piper.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I don’t know about
luck, but like I started to tell you in there, Junior insisted on us checking
on the first aid supplies here, of all places, first today.  That’s twice we’ve
run into you guys in two days, bro!” said Higgs, as a young mother ran up to
where Junior and the other little lost Piper sat.  Junior relinquished the
little girl’s hand to her mother’s and started walking in our direction.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah...funny, isn’t
it?” I mused as the rest of my tour group began to enter the opposite end of
the little hallway we were in.  I thought I now knew why Lauren had been so
against changing the schedule around this morning, and who she had been looking
for since we’d arrived here.  Sister Hertburg emerged from a room at the end of
the hallway and shuffled in my direction.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Move aside!  Tour group
coming through!” announced Sister Hertburg.  “Got to stay on schedule!”  She
swiped me to the side and nearly ran into Higgs.  “Oh!  Dr. Higgins!”  Sister
Hertburg stopped abruptly and sprang to her full four and a half foot height. 
Apparently Dr. Higgins was worth interrupting the schedule for.  The people
following just behind her bumped to a stop.  Sister Hertburg spun around and
announced, “Brothers and Sisters, this is Dr. Hyrum LeGrand Higgins.  He’s the
head physician over at the Hill Cumorah during the Pageant this year.”  She
turned back around to face us and turned her razor sharp attention toward
sizing me up.  “And who’s this?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “This, Sister Hertburg,”
said Higgs, as he took me by the elbow, knocking Piper in the head again, “This
is the best missionary companion I ever had!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Sister Hertburg’s eyes
glared at me for an uncomfortably long moment, then she turned back to her tour
group and yell-whispered, “This man is in the Second Quorum of the Seventy!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            At this statement, I saw
the yellow-visored leader of the purple T-shirts pause as he snuck another
m&amp;m and raise one of his eyebrows.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You mean one of the ‘nobody’
General Authorities?” came a voice from the rear of the group.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh no,” I mumbled.  Not
only was I now misidentified (again), but my terrible example of irreverently
referring to members of the Seventies Quorums as “nobody general authorities”
was catching up to me, too.  That comment could only have come from one of my
kids.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Tony!” gasped Tony’s
mother.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Sorry, mom,” the boy
apologized.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            So, surprisingly (yet
again!), here was another incident that hadn’t originated from my family!</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            But, back to reality. 
The yellow-visored guy was chuckling at Tony’s comment, now.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No,” said Higgs,
laughing, “Elder McGreg here taught me to speak the Kamsplazi language.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I expected cricket
chirps and blank looks.  This is the normal reaction that the majority of
people give whenever they hear the word “Kamsplazi.”  However, I could hardly
believe it when the whole group gasped all at once.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Really?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Are you serious?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wow!  Kamsplazi!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Can you believe it?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It’s a miracle!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Suddenly, everyone was
looking at me.  Sister Hertburg even looked like she might smile (but only
slightly).  The guy sneaking another m&amp;m froze in mid-sneak again.  From
somewhere near the back, one of the purple shirted youth called out, “Can you
say something in Kamsplazi for us?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Um, okay, how about...”
I glanced over at Higgs and smiled.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Having been his trainer,
I had watched our mission president “promote” him throughout the remainder of
my own mission from trainee all the way to Assistant to the President --- never
failing to mention that “Higginses are good pioneer stock” at every possible
occasion.  All that time, I knew that he hadn’t ever fulfilled one of the basic
training requirements: to memorize the Articles of Faith in his assigned
language.  When I’d asked Higgs about that omission during my humiliating exit
interview with him, he’d laughed it off as a “Mary versus Marsha” thing.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “How about the First
Article of Faith?” I said.  Higgs gave me an embarrassed smile back.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Back to the open-mouthed
group around us, though.  I was still a little flummoxed, myself, that my
knowledge of the Kamsplazi language, which had always generated slightly less
excitement in others than, say, a weirdly-shaped wart, was somehow now making
me a linguistic rock-star to this group.  “Treb speeg Diaza, Splitza wooz
Esperisplaz, joob treb speeg Splitza Sploo, Spleso Kato, joob treb speeg Spligm
Erisplaz.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wow!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It’s like he’s speaking
in tongues or something.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I wonder if he’ll be
called to be a mission president.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Mom, can I get his
autograph on my Book of Mormon?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Okay, I have to admit, I
was smiling at this point.  I’d completely forgotten that I’d just run into
Higgs in the bathroom.  And now, from the looks of it, Higgs was, maybe for the
first time in his life, realizing he was <i>not</i> the most popular guy in the
room.  I was for some reason!  Me!  The purple shirts in our tour group were
almost to the point of clapping for my rendition of the First Article of Faith
in Kamsplazi when I finally found Megan’s face.  She winked at me and I smiled
back.  I saw Easton on one side of her and Marianna on the other.  On
Marianna’s other side were Lauren and...Junior.  I decided I would deal with
that later, though.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “That,” barked Sister
Hertburg, immediately silencing her flock and pulling our attention back to
her, “was...inspiring.  Well, we’d better get moving.  Would you like to join
our tour...”  I suspected she was addressing Higgs at this point.  “...Elder
McCraig?” she finished.  Holy cow!  She had said my name right and everything! 
“Oh, and you, too, Doctor Higgins?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Sure!  We’d love to!”
said Higgs enthusiastically, but Sister Hertburg and the rest of the tour group
were looking at <i>me</i>, waiting for <i>my</i> answer.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Um, well, okay, yeah,
that would be great,” I answered.  Seeing as how I’d started out with them in
the first place, it only seemed fitting.  The only thing I didn’t understand,
though, was why this group all seemed to be so impressed with my experience
with the Kamsplazi language.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The group started to
file past us to a waiting elevator.  Megan, the kids and Junior walked past,
Lauren screaming “NOT A WORD!” to me with her eyes as she passed.  Piper
skipped ahead to catch up with Megan while Higgs and I followed, me shaking a
few hands as people passed us.  The group was packing into the elevator with
Sister Hertburg, who had her finger jammed onto the button to hold the door
open.  Just as Higgs and I were about to follow the entire group in, the
m&amp;m guy at the back of the elevator ate another m&amp;m and sister Hertburg
took her finger off the button.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Twenty!” she called. 
“No more allowed on.  You two will have to take the stairs and meet us.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “We’ll race you, then!”
said Higgs.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The doors slid shut in
front of us, me watching helplessly as Megan shrugged.  Marianna flashed her
best kindergarten smile, Easton gave me a thumbs-up, and Lauren looked into
Higgs the Younger’s eyes---much to my chagrin---smiling!</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Come on, Elder McGreg,
let’s beat them!” Higgs the Elder chirped, and took off toward the stairwell.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs and I exited the
stairwell onto the second floor and waited by the elevator door.  And waited. 
And waited.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You think they got
lost?” Higgs asked, winking at me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I think we’d probably
better head up the stairs.  They would’ve gotten here by---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Suddenly, I heard the
sound of screaming from the floor above us and heard the unmistakable sound of
Megan yelling, “Easton!  What are you doing?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I knew it had to happen
sometime!” I grunted and took off into the stairwell.  I raced up the steps
three at a time with Higgs following behind.  We burst from the door and almost
stumbled to a fall, only avoiding it by grabbing onto each other and ending up
in an embrace.  As soon as we skidded to a halt, I looked over toward where the
screams were coming from and got hit in the eye by a slimy, wet m&amp;m.  I
don’t know: was it fortunate that it had missed the bruise on my forehead?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Ow!” I yelled, rubbing
my eye.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I shoved Higgs away,
snapped fully upright and took in the scene with my uninjured eye.  The whole
group had formed a purplish circle around the m&amp;m guy wearing the yellow
visor.  The m&amp;m guy’s face was a deep shade of red and Easton was standing
behind him, his arms wrapped around the guy’s torso, looking like he was about
to squeeze the chocolate out of him.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Easton!  What are you
doing?” I spluttered, echoing Megan’s question I’d heard from below.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “He just…saved…my life!”
the m&amp;m guy gasped.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I looked from face to
face, trying to figure out what was going on.  Everyone was looking at me
strangely.  Finally, Piper pointed to the ground beside me where the slimy, wet
m&amp;m was lying on the floor.  I rubbed my forehead again and put two and two
together to get a fraction.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Dr. Higgins, this young
man will be applying for your job pretty soon!” cackled Sister Hertburg.  “He
just did the Heimlich maneuver on that man and squeezed that candy right out of
his throat.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I don’t know what
happened,” said the m&amp;m guy, his color looking much better, now.  “I, uh,
ate one...”  At this, Sister Hertburg tisked and shook her head.  “And then I
started laughing at a joke I was telling to my son,” he explained, pointing to
the kid who had the missionary name-tag on his purple T-shirt, “and all of a
sudden I couldn’t breathe.  It was terrifying!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Thank goodness this
young man had the presence of mind to realize what was happening and stepped in
to help!” Sister Hertburg said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And then everyone
started clapping for Easton.  He held up his hands in embarrassment, but smiled
and said “You’re welcome” to the m&amp;m guy who was bear-hugging him in the
middle of the applauding group.  He finally relaxed his hold on Easton a
little, then took him by the arm and approached Higgs and me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Brother McCraig,
right?” he asked.  Wow.  Two correct pronouncers in the same day and place.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes, sir,” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’m Larry.  Larry
Evans, and this is my son Jonathan,” he said, motioning to the missionary
name-tagged boy who had just walked up with him.  In the background, I saw
Marianna, who was eavesdropping intently to Brother Evans as he gave his name. 
She cocked her head to the side slightly and looked up as if she were trying to
figure out the square root of a large number.  However, Sister Hertburg was simultaneously
trying to corral the group back together, so Marianna found herself enveloped
and carried away by the moving mass.  Megan looked over and pantomimed that she
and the three girls were going off with the group to look at the exhibits.  I
nodded that I would catch up to them.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Brother McCraig, not to
minimize how grateful I am to your son for saving my life, but it’s such a
miracle that <i>you</i> are here!” said Brother Evans.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            At this statement, I
turned my head to the side.  Why would it be such a miracle that <i>I</i> was
here?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’m not quite sure what
you mean,” I said, glancing over at Higgs, who still had a smile on his face,
but it seemed to be faltering.  He didn’t seem to be accustomed to others
figuratively shoving him to the side.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well, you may have
noticed that this group of people wearing purple shirts is here together,” he
prompted.  I nodded courteously.  “We’ve brought my son, Jonathan here,” he
said, grabbing Jonathan by the shoulder and pointing at his missionary name
tag, “as a sort of missionary farewell trip.  We thought it would be good for
him to experience the birthplace of the Restoration before he headed out to the
MTC,” said Brother Evans.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            He continued to
conspicuously point at the name tag for a few seconds.  I must have had a confused
look on my face, because he nodded in his son’s direction.  I looked at the
name tag again.  It was the standard missionary name tag as far as I could
tell.  It had “Elder Evans” on it with the name of the Church below it, just
like I was used to seeing it.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You don’t see it?”
Brother Evans asked, a little disappointment coming through in his voice.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Sorry,” I said, and
then looked back at the name-tag once more, this time with a little more
concentration.  I tried to see what Brother Evans wanted me to see.  Suddenly,
I realized what was going on.  The name of the Church on Jonathan’s name tag
was written in Kamsplazi!  It had been so natural for me to read it that I
hadn’t realized the difference right off.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh!” I said almost
involuntarily.  Then I laughed for a second and, for an instant, lost track of
where and when I was.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Elder Higgins!  Dude,
look at that!” I said quickly, grabbing Higgs by the neck in the crook of my
arm to take a look.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs looked at Jonathan
Evans’s name tag and then asked, “What language is that?”  I think he was
serious.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It’s Kamsplazi,”
Jonathan mercifully answered for me.  He pointed over at me and went on,
“Brother McCraig wrote a dictionary.  I ordered it off of the Internet a couple
weeks ago.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We chatted for a few
minutes, talking “shop” about the Kamsplazi language (“Sort of looks like
somebody fell on a typewriter, if you ask me,” the older Brother Evans mused)
and where we had served and where Jonathan was going to go.  A few minutes
later, we re-joined the group as it came back to the elevator.  I met Megan at
the back of the group, along with Piper, Easton, Marianna, Lauren, and,
surprisingly, without the usual annoyance factor, Junior.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I have to admit, this
visit is going a lot better than I thought it---” I started.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And, as if I were being
punished in the very act of counting my blessing chickens just before they’d
hatched, I heard the loud squeal of a cat coming from downstairs.  Piper’s eyes
widened and she bolted for the stairwell.  I followed after her.  Megan
followed me.  I don’t know who followed after Megan, but it sure sounded like a
lot of people.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I caught up with Piper
at the base of the stairs where she had stopped short of the lobby area we’d
first entered just after the tent collapse.  There, in the main foyer of the E.
B. Grandin building, one of the hallmarks of church history, the place where
the Book of Mormon was first published, I was watching a flying, frenzied,
feline ball of fur yowl its way around the room in front of dozens of onlookers
I’d gotten to meet throughout the morning at one mishap after another.  The
funny thing was, I was  not only laughing, I was absolutely jubilant!</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I had been expecting to
see our gray and white cat Angel causing the ruckus.  As it turned out, though,
what I saw was Tony, the young purple-shirted boy, curled up into a ball, his
arms covering his head.  He was right under the door of the pot-bellied stove,
which he must have just opened.  Strands of straw and scraps of paper and other
flotsam hung from the opening.  Turns out that a gray-brown mouse had evidently
been living there comfortably for quite some time, judging from the dates I
could see on some of the pieces of paper sticking out from the stove.  The
mouse was leading an orange tabby cat, clearly not <i>our </i>cat, on a
helter-skelter chase around the front room, to the obvious shock of the new
tour group.  The tourists at the entrance squealed as they parted, allowing the
rodent and pursuer to escape out the front door, which was being held open by
Sister Hertburg.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We decided to return for
lunch that day to the ice cream shack, which reminded me of Gadianton the
Great’s ransom and deadline.  Fortunately, except for my m&amp;m-injured eye,
that day’s miracles continued to be showered down upon us.  No one dropped an
ice cream cone and Angel did <i>not</i> escape during lunch.  He <i>did</i>
manage to gross out Marianna by getting his head through the bars of his cage
door to lick her ice cream cone, but it grossed her out so visibly that it was
well worth the price of the replacement cone.  In fact, our luck had been so
good that I was starting to feel a little nervous: our misfortune debt was
building up, and even though the saying is cliché, it wasn’t a matter of <i>if</i>,
but <i>when</i> karma would come collecting.  With that on my mind, we finished
lunch and took our journey to the next destination written in Marianna’s pink
and purple notebook: the Sacred Grove.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Now <i>that</i> has to
be the temple,” said Easton, finally pointing to the correct building.  “It’s
got the gold guy on top of it and everything!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “His name is ‘Moroni,’
moron!” corrected Lauren, lazily turning another page in her book.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Though I was starting to
worry a bit about what could go wrong, honestly, my spirits were still pretty
high at this point.  Not only had we managed to make it through the Grandin
Building unscathed, we’d also managed to save someone’s life and get a standing
ovation in the process!  So, as we pulled into the overflowing parking lot of
the Sacred Grove, I mustered up some faith and confidence that all would go
well with our visit this afternoon.  If I willed it intensely enough, it just
might happen, right?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay, just like last
time,” I began.  “Let’s leave Angel here by the van in his carrier.  Piper, did
you get him back into it?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I heard Piper latch the
carrier door shut and Angel whimper, followed by a thumbs-up from Piper in the
rear-view mirror.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Alright!  Let’s go!” I
over-enthused, at which Megan gave me a surprised smile.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You’re in a good mood
today,” she said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah, everything is
going to be under control today,” I said, stepping out and closing the door
behind me.  “I’m choosing to believe that things will continue to go well for
us this afternoon.  Lauren, as for the vampire book---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan did a small,
subtle shake with her head, and I made a mid-course correction.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well, you can bring it
along if you want.  But is it okay if you leave its jacket in the van?  It
might just give the impression that you brought your scriptures,” I said,
winking involuntarily --- although in this situation, it could have been me
being in on a joke with her.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Lauren halted, and I
could swear there was a micro-expression of suspicion on her face.  But she
recovered quickly, and to my amazement, instead of just the book jacket, she
obediently put the entire book back into the van before closing her door.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan looked at me and
raised an eyebrow on that one, too.  She seemed to have noticed Lauren’s odd
reaction, as well.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We walked toward the
Smith Farm welcome center and, summoning more faith and trusting that our
recent luck in the absence-of-mishaps department wouldn’t run out, I opened the
doors for everyone to enter.  A smiling pair of young sister missionaries welcomed
us and invited us to sit in another block of standard Church-issue folding
chairs along with a couple dozen other visitors.  Megan gave my hand a quick
squeeze and smiled when she saw me looking at how remarkably well our kids were
behaving.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Welcome to the Smith
Family Farm, brothers and sisters,” one of the young sister missionaries began.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I thought we were going
to the Sacred Grove,” whispered Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “We are.  It’s part of
the Smith Family Farm,” answered Marianna.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It was here that in the
spring of 1820, the fourteen-year old Joseph Smith left his home, which stood
where the log home now sits to your left.”  She pointed out through a set of
large windows behind her at the small wooden home, reminiscent of a log cabin,
where another tour group was just entering.  “He entered the grove of trees on
your right,” she continued, pointing toward the other side of the windows,
causing all heads in our group to loll to the right, sort of like a slow-moving
tennis match.  “There, he prayed to know which of all the churches he should
join.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            On cue, the other sister
missionary jumped in with her part: “In response to that prayer, God the Father
and his Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph and answered that he should join
none of them---that the true Church was not then on the Earth.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As the sister
missionaries volleyed their presentation back and forth about the log home, the
frame home, the Sacred Grove and the grounds all around, my neck was starting
to get tired.  I stopped listening for a bit, rubbed my eye, and looked at my
watch.  It was past one o’clock.  My thoughts returned to Gadianton’s price.  I’d
have to get away from everyone at some point and go leave my CTR ring in
Gadianton’s Bathroom, and try to be surreptitious about it.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I looked out the windows
past all of the locations the sister missionaries were talking about and saw
several groups of visitors.  These groups were walking up and down the pathways
between the different structures, and I wondered if there were a set order that
we had to follow.  It turned out that I didn’t have to wonder long.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Brothers and sisters,
from here, we’ll take you over to the log home.  After that, you’ll visit the
frame house and the threshing barn.  Finally, you’ll be able to go into the
Sacred Grove itself.  We encourage you to be reverent in the Grove so that you
can not only feel the Spirit yourselves, but allow others to feel it as well. 
Yes?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I was alarmed to follow
the sister missionary’s gaze to Easton’s raised hand.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Were all the trees in
the Sacred Grove here when Joseph Smith saw the First Vision?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Note to self,” I
thought.  “Make sure there are no hatchets in the van or on Easton’s person
when we go out the door.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “That’s a very good
question,” the other sister missionary began as Easton, I could observe out of
the corner of my eye, pulled a wrinkled piece of paper and a pencil to write
down her answer.  “As a matter of fact, not many of the trees now standing in the
Sacred Grove existed in 1820.  Many of the original trees were cut down in
order to farm the land or to provide materials for building homes and
structures in the local area.  However, there <i>are</i> some trees in the
western part of the Grove that may be old enough to have witnessed the First
Vision.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            At this, the room became
silent.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Do you know where they
are?” Easton asked, his pencil poised over his paper, which, now that I looked
closer, seemed covered with diagrams and notes in his twelve year old scrawl.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The sister missionary
explained where she thought the oldest trees were and what they looked like:
gnarled up old beech and maple trees with massive, hollow trunks on the western
edge of the Grove.  Easton struggled to scribble fast enough to keep up with
the sister missionary’s description, and then, when Easton had finished, he
looked up as if thinking, nodded to himself, and stuffed the paper back into
his pocket.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I’ll be honest.  I had
never heard about these trees before on my previous visits, and Marianna hadn’t
mentioned this subject even once during our family home evening lessons about
Palmyra leading up to this trip.  After we left the welcome center, my thoughts
during our charmed, uneventful visits to the log home and the frame home were on
those trees, and just why Easton seemed to be so interested in them.  We were
finally “released” by the sister missionaries after visiting the threshing
barn, where we stepped out onto a wood chip covered pathway which led into the
Sacred Grove.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Cool, look at this
sign, Dad,” said Easton, pointing at a blue sign staked beside the path at the
edge of the Sacred Grove.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah, Easton.  It says,
‘Please stay on established paths.’  That means you, too,” I reminded him.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, not that part.  The
bottom part of the sign,” he said.  Then he started reading, “‘During
thunderstorms or periods of high winds, visitors should exit the Grove
immediately, due to hazardous conditions.’  What hazardous conditions?” he
asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I pointed up at the
towering trees.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “In a thunderstorm,
lightning could strike a tree, or the wind could break branches off and those
could fall---” I began to explain.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “And crush you,” Lauren
finished simply.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Everyone looked up at
the sky to make sure the coast was clear.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The weather should be
fine this afternoon,” Megan reassured them, and then began ushering them into
the Grove.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The towering maples,
poplars, and beech trees spread wide overhead, providing ample shade from the
afternoon’s hot sun.  Families sat together on benches scattered along the
paths.  The soft dirt beneath our feet muted the noise of walking, allowing us
to enjoy the quiet breeze.  After almost an hour of wandering around the Sacred
Grove, with Piper only having been brought to us by strangers twice (a good
score for us!), we finally came upon a group of trees which stood about twenty
yards away from the edge of the path.  They had gnarled and knotted trunks
twisting high into the sky.  One had a large fissure at the base of the massive
trunk, like an inverted “V,” allowing a shaft of afternoon sunlight to shine
down onto a mound of brown leaves on the ground inside the hollow heart of the
tree.  Everywhere else, old, knotty branches supported awkward clumps of bright
green leaves high above.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Is this it?  The oldest
trees, Dad?” Easton asked quietly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I nodded slowly.  “Looks
like it to me.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Easton fished his wadded
paper from one of his pockets.  He unfolded it and began to draw.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “How old do you think
those trees are, Dad?” Piper asked from beside me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hmmm,” I began.  “Well,
if they were here for the First Vision, then that would mean they were at least
200 years old.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Is that old for a
tree?” Marianna asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “That’s old for anything
living,” Lauren answered, and then added, “Just look at Dad!” in an undertone.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We convinced a passerby
to take a picture of our family with the scraggliest-looking tree  in the
background.  Easton pocketed his art project, we all smiled for the picture,
and then we headed for the exit.  As we walked, I brought up the rear of our family,
thinking quietly to myself.  The best word for describing our walk through the
Sacred Grove that day is “sublime.”  It felt almost like we were all walking
through a temple together.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            After a couple minutes
of this peaceful reverie, I noticed that Lauren was walking along beside me. 
This, in and of itself, was unusual.  What came next was even more strange.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Dad,” she began, and
this is where the bliss began to crumble, and I could suddenly sense karma
making its move.  “Can I ask you something?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%;page-break-before:always'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I was still feeling a
little numb from Lauren’s question.  I stood by the water fountain back in the
Smith Farm welcome center, absentmindedly holding the knob so that the water
was continuously running.  It was now almost three o’clock.  One hour to go
till my deal with Gadianton the Great came due.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan had suggested we
stop there to get a drink and use the restrooms before heading out.  Megan and
the girls went in their direction.  Easton declined the opportunity, so I gave
him the keys to the van and was waiting for the girls.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            A dance.  Lauren had
asked me if she could go to a dance.  Lauren doesn’t dance.  Period.  As a
general rule, touching other people is not something she allows in her world. 
Being a man of large personal space myself, I can understand that.  It’s
genetic.  But now she was asking to go to a dance.  Tonight.  But the real
kicker was that it was a cast-and-crew dance for pageant personnel, and she had
been invited by someone I detested, not only on the principle that he was
interested in my daughter, but also because he was a Higgins.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And the day had been
going so well up to that point!</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I shook my head to clear
it and saw that Megan and the girls were waiting by the exit for me while a
group of new visitors was entering.  I let go of the water fountain knob
without taking a drink.  I was still trying to process the concept of “Lauren”
and “dance” being in the same thought space.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Come on up front.  There
are plenty of seats up here,” a familiar voice called to the newly arrived tour
group.  I jerked my head sideways and saw Elder Rindlisbacher motioning with
his arm in a friendly way towards the group of people coming through the door
beside us.  But then his eyes fell on me, and when he realized who I was, his
arm froze mid-wave and the corners of his mouth turned down at the same time
his eyes narrowed.  I smiled, did a half-hearted wave, and involuntarily
blinked from the earlier Grandin-building m&amp;m episode, and became suddenly
aware that his wife had just appeared behind him, which only strengthened the
downturn of his mouth.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Seeing that the group
had finished filing in, and that it was high-time for us to be out of the
Rindlisbachers’ presence, I started to follow Megan out the door with the girls
when the door suddenly burst open in front of us.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Dad!  Angel’s in the
Sacred Grove!” Easton yelled.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Everyone in the room
suddenly gasped, the room became very reverent, and Elder Rindlisbacher’s
countenance changed.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Angel?  In the Grove?”
he whispered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah,” answered Easton
off-handedly, walking over to the water fountain I’d just left and bending down
to get a drink.  He slurped for a few seconds, and then hiccuped, “I just saw
him.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            A split second seemed to
last an eternity, with only the sound of Easton’s follow-up sloppy water
slurping as accompaniment.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Beulah,” said Elder
Rindlisbacher, cinching his pants up by his belt.  “Better turn up your hearing
aide.  We’ve got a ‘Code Moroni’ on our hands!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Sister Rindlisbacher,
one hand reaching for her heart and the other feeling for a chair beside her,
nodded blankly as Elder Rindlisbacher went over to the front office door,
opened it, and entered.  “Sister Hansen, I need...,” and here, he nodded
meaningfully, “...the Red Book!”  I heard gasps and “Oh my’s” coming from
inside the office, followed by a pause, then the sound of papers flying and
chairs squeaking upright.  A set of keys jangled maniacally and then a small
cabinet door creaked open.  I heard a ripping of Velcro, and then Elder
Rindlisbacher re-emerged from the office door, this time holding a spiral bound
book in his right hand, the kind you’d see a pilot carrying as they climbed
into a high-performance fighter.  This book had a bright red cover labeled “Sacred
Grove Emergency Procedures” in large gold lettering.  His left hand held a
cordless red phone to his ear, already lit up.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Elder Rindlisbacher
directed his attention to Easton and asked, “Is he still in the Grove?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Easton had just finished
another long draught of water.  He stifled (unsuccessfully) a belch, leaned
backwards to peek out the door toward the Grove.  “Yeah, he’s still in there.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            My ears nearly popped as
the entire room gasped again.  Suddenly I realized what everyone was thinking. 
They thought a heavenly messenger had just appeared in the Sacred Grove.  I
jerked my gaze over to Elder Rindlisbacher, who was flipping madly through the
emergency procedures book.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Let’s see,” he
muttered.  “Three Nephites, no....Flaming sword, no....Donnie and Marie,
no....Here it is!  Unspecified Angel!”  He touched a button on the red phone he
had pressed to his ear and looked down to his checklist.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Meanwhile, I could also
hear my family having their own conversation.  “Mom,” I heard Lauren ask.  “Do
you have any gum?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Let me check,” Megan
said, opening her bag up.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, I want some, too!”
Marianna chirped.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Sister Hansen,” Elder
Rindlisbacher called into the office.  “Look on page ninety-six, step four, and
make the announcement!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            From speakers in the
ceiling within the welcome center, and from loudspeakers outside, Sister Hansen’s
quavering voice announced, “At the request of the First Presidency and Quorum
of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
please proceed directly to your vehicles in an orderly fashion and depart the
parking lot.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, that’s the gross
watermelon flavored gum.  Don’t you have any of the strawberry kind?” Lauren
asked Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I like watermelon
flavor,” said Easton, quickly grabbing the gum from Megan’s outstretched hand.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I want a piece of
strawberry, too, Mom,” Piper said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The tour group seated in
the welcome center began rising from their chairs, obstructing my view of Elder
Rindlisbacher.  I could still hear him, though.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes, this is Elder
Rindlisbacher at the Smith Family Farm welcome center in Palmyra...  Yes, the
Sacred Grove...Yes, this <i>is</i> a Code Moroni....  Who?  Me?  Now?  I...I
guess so.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The other visitors filed
out past us.  I pantomimed to Megan for her and the gum-chomping-kids to stay
put.  As the final guests exited the welcome center, Elder Rindlisbacher, his
eyes wide and wild, covered the mouthpiece of the red phone and looked over at
me.  “Is he still in the Grove?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Piper went to the door
and looked this time.  “No,” she said thickly through her gum.  (Apparently
she’d put in three or four pieces.)  At this, Elder Rindlisbacher seemed to
take a deep breath of relief.  But then Piper added: “Not any more.  He’s
coming up the sidewalk, now.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I heard a groan from
Sister Rindlisbacher as she slumped over in her chair.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Elder Rindlisbacher, his
voice hoarse, jerked straight, his face white.  “Yes, P-P-President.  This is
Elder Rindlisbacher.  Yes, he is heading up the sidewalk to the welcome center.” 
Elder Rindlisbacher looked over at us with questioning eyes.  Easton and Piper,
still chomping gum, leaned back and peeked out the door windows again, then
smiled and gave a perfectly simultaneous set of four thumbs up, a bubble
forming from Easton’s mouth.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wait---“ I stammered. 
I had to head this off.  It sounded as if this misunderstanding had already
gone way too far, but if I was going to salvage the rest of our day, I had to
try.  Elder Rindlisbacher was furiously motioning for the missionaries in the
office to come out.  “You misunderstood---“ I tried again.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I don’t know President,”
said Elder Rindlisbacher.  “I will follow the instructions on page
ninety-seven.  Okay, then, that’s what I’ll do.  Thank you, President.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Then it dawned on me who
the “President” might be that he kept addressing.  Was it <i>the</i> president?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “He’s almost here,” said
Piper, clearly excited that this occasion seemed to be so important.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan pulled a dusty,
three year old nugget out of the bottom of her bag and sniffed it.  “I’ve only
got one piece of strawberry.  Lauren asked first,” she said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Elder Rindlisbacher,” I
said as quickly as I could.  “I’m afraid there’s been a big mistake.  It’s
not---“</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “He’s here!  Should I
let him in?” Piper asked, drooling slightly from the excess of gum in her mouth.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wait!” said a younger
sister missionary, suddenly emerging from the office with a box of latex exam
gloves.  “Put these on before asking to shake his hand!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            This struck me as a
little absurd, and I hesitated for a moment to reflect on that absurdity. 
However, I didn’t think it would help matters for me to ask what good a pair of
latex exam gloves would do when dealing with a possible evil spirit
masquerading as an angel of light.  Elder Rindlisbacher traded his red phone
for the pair of the gloves and snapped them on.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay,” said Elder
Rindlisbacher, crouching down as if ready to field a fly ball.  “Let him in.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Piper snapped her gum
cheerily as she opened the door.  The room went silent.  The sister
missionaries in the office peeked from behind the door casing.  Sister
Rindlisbacher was still out cold.  And slowly, our cat walked in through the
door Piper had just opened for him, sat down on the floormat in front of us,
hiked up his back leg, and started licking himself.</p>

<p class=Standard align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>* * *</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Who knew they had
procedures for angels appearing in the Sacred Grove?&quot; mused Megan as we
pulled out of the now-empty parking lot of the Smith Farm, an angry
Rindlisbacher couple standing on the sidewalk in the rear-view mirror behind
us, and a pair of young sister missionaries still peering toward the grove.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Let’s just get out of
here before anything else can go wrong,” I grumbled.  “Is the cat in his
carrier?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Piper’s hand with
outstretched thumb appeared above the other heads in the back seat.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The real question,
though, is what are the procedures for when Donnie and Marie come,”  Megan
asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>“They probably
get to skip lines like the Higginses,” I grumbled to myself.  “Where are we
going, now, Marianna?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='margin-left:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>“Next on the list
is the Hill Cumorah!” said Marianna.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Good!  It was now 3:40,
and I was running out of time to meet Gadianton’s demand.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We arrived at the Hill
Cumorah visitor’s center parking lot and followed the pointing parking
attendants to a spot.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Megan, can you get
everyone into the visitor’s center?  I need to stop by the bathroom,” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan looked at me
suspiciously.  I don’t know how, but she knew something was up.  Fortunately,
she simply said, “Okay then...”  I figured she was classing this in with
birthday and Christmas gift lies, so I promised myself to fill her in on this
benevolent deception after we’d all become Nephites.  Or Lamanites.  Or, maybe
Gadianton would end up making us Zoramites, based on what I’d heard from him so
far.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As I made my way up the
sidewalks to Gadianton’s Bathroom, I pulled the ring off and put it into a
plastic baggie and sealed it.  Inside the bathroom, I found the stall and
entered it.  After closing the door, I held the baggie in my hand and thought.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I suddenly felt all
wrong.  Was dying as some manner of –ite in the pageant really worth leaving
that CTR ring behind a toilet?  What would it mean to the kids if they saw that
I was no longer wearing it?  Would they think I was embarrassed by it?  Or had
lost it?  Would they think that it meant so little to me that I would
carelessly misplace it?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And then I knew.  I
couldn’t give it away.  It was a bond between my kids and me, and exchanging it
like this was an insult to that bond.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Back outside Gadianton’s
Bathroom, I took out my phone and dialed Gadianton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Did you deliver the
package,” he answered, without even saying “hello.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wait, I thought a
package was a person,” I said, looking over toward our van to see if anyone
were watching.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Did you leave the CTR
ring in the stall?  Zoramites...holy cow...”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, not yet,” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Then what are you
calling about?” asked Gadianton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I wondered if you could
do the exchange for something else?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No deal.  The CTR ring,
or no crowd.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’m sorry, but my kids
gave me that CTR ring, and I can’t hurt their feelings by giving it away!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Click.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Great.  Gadianton had
been my best hope.  What was I going to do now?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            The
short version of our experience at the Hill Cumorah visitor’s center is this:
nothing happened.  The cat did not escape from its carrier beside the van.  Neither
one of the Higgses showed up.  Piper set a record by only getting lost and
having us paged once.  Easton spent some time at the diorama of the environs
around the Hill Cumorah drawing lines on his art project.  He showed me his
favorite painting in the exhibit: one showing the prophet Mormon in a cave with
shelves filled with stacks and stacks of bound metal plates.  We did have to
interrupt Marianna when she began leading a group of youth from somewhere in
New Jersey around the exhibits.  She was giving a convincingly authoritative
lecture on church history in the Palmyra area.  Lauren quietly visited all the
exhibits with her mother.  Me?</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>I had two things
on my mind: first, the dance that Lauren wanted to go to; and second, whether
there were any other way to get us into the pageant.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As for the dance, I had
mentioned to Megan that Lauren wanted to go to said dance and asked what she
thought.  Of course, she thought it was absolutely wonderful.  Traitor!  How
could she take the Higgs’ side of this?  I sulked away from the rest of them
and looked at the display copy of the Book of Mormon translated into Kamsplazi,
trying to remember my long-gone glory from earlier in the day.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>After we’d all
seen everything there was to see, including the Christus statue and a Church
film about the restoration of the gospel, we walked out into the sun through
the south side doors of the visitor’s center.  We could see the rows and rows
of chairs set up for tomorrow night’s first showing of the Hill Cumorah
Pageant.  And on the left, there was Gadianton’s Bathroom.  I checked the
time.  It was 4:45.  The deadline had passed.  While I felt confident looking
at my CTR ring, I still wished there were a way….</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>“Is that where
we’ll be sitting?” Piper asked, jerking me back from Gadianton’s band of latter-day
artifact plunderers.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “Yes,
but we may need to come a little early in order to get seats toward the front
so we can see better,” I answered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “Do
we get to go to the top?” asked Easton, holding his art project in one hand and
pointing with the other up the hillside to where the golden statue of Moroni
stood.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            I
looked at the walkway leading up the hill in that direction.  A white gate
stretched across the walkway and a sign stood in the middle which read, “Cast
members only.”  Salt in my wound!</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “I
don’t think we’re allowed to go up there while the pageant is going on,” I
answered, pointing at the sign.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “Oh,
it’s still open,” someone said from behind me.  I turned to look and saw
another missionary couple emerging from the visitor’s center doors behind us. 
“There’s a dirt path over there to the left that goes through the woods and
winds around the hill up to the statue.  You can also drive up.  The road is
still open.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “Dad,
can we take the path?” Easton asked quickly, his face bursting with excitement.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>“Yeah!  Can we,
dad?” Piper echoed.  Marianna bounced.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “I
have an idea,” said Megan.  “Will, you take those three and walk up the path. 
I’ll drive the van up to the top with Lauren.”  Megan winked at me, by which I
guessed she would be talking with Lauren about the dance invitation.  I
reasoned that that was the wiser path to take.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>And before I
could foul anything up any further, it was decided.  I was chasing after three
of my children who had just disappeared into the woods behind the visitor’s
center while the Megan-Lauren confederacy sauntered off toward the van.  Of
course, I couldn’t keep up with my three.  Too many months behind a computer
workstation at work had put me out of breath halfway up the trail.  I leaned on
my knees, gasping, listening to Marianna’s voice ahead of me as she read the
plaques on the base of the statue of Moroni out loud.  As I caught my breath, I
started to hear something else, too.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            This
other sound was coming from a clump of bushes several yards away from the path
my sweat was just then dripping on.  It was the sound of a shovel plunging into
the earth over and over again.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>“Who would be
digging over there during pageant week?” I thought to myself, peering into the
hopelessly thick brush to see what was going on.  “Actually, who would be
digging over there, period?”  Suddenly, there was a loud <i>clunk</i>, as the
shovel hit what sounded like something hard, followed by the highly recognizable
sound of Easton’s voice saying, “Yes!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>“Easton?” I
called.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>The shoveling
abruptly stopped and all was quiet except for birds chirping and Marianna’s
voice reading the monument some distance above us.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “Easton,
I heard your voice.  What are you doing in there?” I said, straightening up and
venturing off the path, trying to find a way around the thicket of thorns and
briars between Easton and me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “Uh...nothing,”
he replied.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “Do
you have a shovel?” I asked, picking my way through.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “Maybe...,”
he said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            As I
emerged into a little clearing on the side of the hill, I found Easton holding
a fold-up shovel, the kind that a special forces Boy Scout would carry.  He was
standing beside a small mound of dirt taken from a hole he’d been digging.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “Okay,
I give up,” I said.  “Why are you digging a hole on the Hill Cumorah?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>Easton switched
the shovel to his other hand and dug his paper art project from his pocket,
unfolded it and held it up for me to see.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “Look,
Dad!  It’s here!  I know it’s right here!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What’s here?” I asked. 
And then I remembered the stove in the E. B. Grandin building, and I realized
what he must be doing.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “Easton,
we shouldn’t be digging up the Hill Cumorah looking for a geo-cache,” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>Easton’s face
turned a sudden shade of confused.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “What
are you talking about?” he asked me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>“The geo-cache. 
You know, like you were saying about the pot-bellied stove at the Grandin
building.  Even if there is one here, it’s not appropriate to be digging holes
all over the Hill Cumorah.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “That’s
not what’s here, Dad,” said Nick.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “Then
what <i>is</i> here?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “You
know!  That room.  The one with all the plates and stuff in it from that
painting.  We saw it down there in the visitor’s center together.  I think I’ve
found it, Dad!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>I felt small
again.  But, in reality, we really couldn’t go digging up the entire hill.  How
was I going to break it to him?</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “So,
Easton, did you end up finding anything here?” I said, trying to stall for
inspiration to burrow its way into my head.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>“I think so!”
said Easton, pointing to the hole he was digging.  “I think I just hit
something solid,” he said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>So, in an effort
to be supportive, I looked over my shoulder in all directions to make sure no
one from “Church security services” would surprise us, and held out my hand for
Easton’s shovel.  He handed it to me.  I started moving dirt away from the
bottom of his hole to expose whatever he’d just uncovered.  At last, it became
apparent what he’d hit.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>Easton hung his
head a little, looked down into the hole and said dejectedly, “I guess I just
hit a rock.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            I
wiped some sweat from my face and tried to think of something to say, hoping
for something good and profound to appear in my thoughts.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “So
what made you pick this spot?” I asked, gesturing toward his papers, covered with
deacon handwriting and geometric shapes overlaid on a map.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “I
kept thinking that whoever made the cave in that painting in the first place
would need a way to find it again, so it would need to be lined up with
something tall.  When we found all those old trees in the Sacred Grove, I
figured those would be landmarks.”  Nick then went on to explain something
about triangles and circles, with special attention to the number of days
between full moons in the summer and some other numbers that made my eyes glaze
over, and how all those numbers then fed into the algorithm on his sheet of
paper and told him to dig at that particular spot.  Finally, I figured that I
needed to burst the proverbial bubble.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “You
realize, Easton, that those trees wouldn’t have started growing for another
thousand years or so after any of the plates were ever stored near here,
right?” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>Easton’s eyes
blinked as he processed this fact.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I hadn’t thought of
that,” he said, sounding somehow reinvigorated.  I sensed new calculations
taking place in his head.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>“C’mon, let’s
fill in your hole and get up to the top before Officer Duke finds us and puts
us in jail for sullying the Hill Cumorah,” I suggested, smiling.  I checked all
around us again, though, just in case.  Easton smiled back.  We shoved and
patted the damp soil back into place, tamped it down with our feet and spread
some leaves over it.  Then we made our way back to the trail and up to where
Megan, Lauren and Marianna were waiting for us by the towering monument topped by
a gleaming statue of the Angel Moroni.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “Where’s
Piper?” I panted to Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>She pointed over
the opposite side of the hill to a concrete landing several feet below.  There,
Piper was kneeling on the ground, stroking through the mangy hair of an orange
and white feral-looking tabby cat.  It reminded me of the cat we’d seen chasing
the mouse back at the Grandin building this morning.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “She’s
made a new friend,” Megan answered, her eyes watching me for my reaction. 
Piper was now covered in dirty cat hair and it kept getting worse with each
passing second as the little cat kept rubbing itself back and forth through
Piper’s loving embraces.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            I
shuddered.  There was only one thing equal to that challenge.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>“Hey Easton?  You
wouldn’t happen to have any duct tape hidden in the van, would you?” I asked,
figuring that if a commando Boy Scout had a shovel, then surely he’d also have
more basic tools.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>It turns out that
he did, in fact, have a roll of duct tape.  So, after dragging Piper away from
the cute little scruffball, taking a family picture under the Angel Moroni, and
after taping all the cat hair off of Piper’s and everyone else’s clothes (it
took over half the roll), we got into the van Megan had driven to the upper
parking lot.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “Ew! 
Don’t put that hairy tape on my side!” I heard Lauren threaten.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “Well
I don’t want it over here!” Marianna yelled back.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “Then
throw it back with Piper instead of over here on me.  She’s the one who did
this!” Lauren said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>Easton suddenly
grabbed the basketball-sized ball of hairy duct tape and lobbed it over his
shoulder into the back, where Piper promptly screamed her disapproval along
with Angel.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “Hey,
everyone!” I called, looking into the rear view mirror at them.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>It didn’t do much
good.  Piper was rolling the hairy ball of tape up over the back of the seat
into Marianna’s lap, much to Marianna’s chagrin.  At that point, Angel started
to chime in with loud yowls.  Easton grabbed for the tape ball again to try to
get it back onto Piper.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>            “Hey!”
I yelled.  Everyone halted what they were doing and stared straight into my
eyes in the mirror.  “This is not how we should be acting on the Hill
Cumorah.”  I explained calmly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.3pt;line-height:200%'>Then I felt the van
go <i>ker-thump</i>.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%;page-break-before:always'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><b><span id='Chapter-11'>11</span></b></p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            &quot;Daddy, you just
killed a little squirrel!&quot; shrieked Piper.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What squirrel?” I shot
back, simultaneously stomping on the brake.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The pretty black and
white one,” Piper sobbed hysterically.  “Daddy, you have to stop and take it to
the animal hospital we saw.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I quickly went through
all the species and sub-species of squirrel I had ever learned about in my
life: red, gray, flying, and secret.  Black-and-white was not in that list.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You mean gray?” I
asked, puzzled.  After all, black plus white equals gray, right?  Maybe Piper
was confused?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            By now, all the kids had
turned their attention from the cat hair duct tape ball to something lying on
the pavement behind us.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Uh-oh,” said Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As I have stated before,
it never portends good when Easton says this.  “No, I think she means exactly
what she said, Dad,” he said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I pulled over, put the van
into park, unbuckled my seatbelt, and opened the door to go investigate this
new species of squirrel.  One of the sayings I have heard repeated from time to
time in church settings is, “You don’t have to see to know.”  This, of course,
refers to spiritual things.  There are, similarly, things in this temporal life
that also adhere to this saying.  For example, the sound of Angel throwing up
didn’t require me to actually <i>see</i> in order to know what had happened on
our drive to Palmyra.  And in this case, as soon as I opened the van door, I
knew what we had hit, and exactly what a black and white squirrel really was. 
And I didn’t have to walk all the way to the back of the vehicle to see it.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What is <i>that</i>?”
Megan asked, her hand evidently clenched over her nose, judging from the nasal
sound of her voice.  Megan had grown up as a city girl.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Apparently,” I gagged
out, “It’s a black and white squirrel.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I gingerly made my way
to the back of the van and peeked around the back tail light to see the lump on
the road.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Is it still alive?”
Megan called out.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Can you please hurry
up?” Lauren called from inside the van, apparently also holding her nose, as
well.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I just want to make
sure the ‘squirrel’ isn’t going to do anything to fight back,” I called.  The
lump on the road was, as Piper had correctly described, black and white.  Fur
bristled in the gentle breeze which, unfortunately for me, was blowing past the
black and white lump in my direction.  The lump wasn’t moving.  Luckily for us,
it looked like a trip to the animal hospital would not be necessary.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I think it’s...” I
started, but then, remembering Piper’s tender feelings on such matters, quickly
made a mid-sentence correction, “It’s...uh, in the Celestial Kingdom, now.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I started back to the
driver’s seat door and was just about to get in and drive away to cleaner air
when Megan asked, “Are we going to just leave it there?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I nodded, as if to say,
“You bet your smelly boots, we are.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “But, daddy, we have to
take it to the animal hospital.  Maybe they can save it!” Piper cried.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I looked back at Piper
with the saddest eyes I could muster.  “Piper, I’m not sure how to say this---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It’s dead.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Yep.  Lauren.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “We have to do something
with it.  It will smell up the entire pageant,” Megan said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            For many years, now, I
have been writing a book in my head.  I started it soon after Megan and I were
married.  It has become my life’s work, my masterpiece, my <i>magnum opus</i>. 
Its title: <i>Spousal Translation Dictionary: Wifese--&gt;Husbandese.  </i>(Honestly,

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            So, when Megan said, “<i>We</i>
have to do something with it,” I mentally flipped through my <i>Spousal
Translation Dictionary, </i>found the right entry, and correctly translated her
utterance as, “<i>You</i> have to do something with it.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I wrinkled my nose up
trying not only to stifle the smell, but also trying to decide what to do. 
Suddenly, it occurred to me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Easton!  Get your
shovel and let’s go bury it!” I coughed through my still-open door.  Piper burst
out crying.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I don’t want to touch
that thing with my shovel!” he called back.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “If we have to, we’ll
buy a new shovel.  Get out here!” I said, finally relenting and pinching my
nose closed, too.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Easton exited the van,
to the coughs and “ews” of all our womenfolk.  He took the long way around the
front of the van and met me, peeking around the same driver’s side back tail
light I had previously hid behind, and held out his fold-up shovel to me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Thanks,” I said without
any sincerity.  I unfolded it out to its longest possible length and started
back toward the black and white lump on the road, my whole family watching me
while literally holding their breath.  As I reached the spot where the
unfortunate animal lay, I gently nudged it with the shovel and backed away
quickly, just in case it was only playing possum.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            It remained motionless.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Summoning up all my
remaining bravery, I crept out from behind my protective tail light and tried
to work the shovel under the hairy mound.  I quickly discovered that the lump
was just too big to fit on the blade of the little fold-up shovel.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Megan, do we have a bag
or anything that we can put this into?” I called to her.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “We aren’t bringing that
thing into the van, Will!” she answered back, triggering another instant
translation in my head.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “That’s not what I
meant.  It won’t fit onto the shovel.  I need some way to carry it off the
road.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Just kick it off with
your foot,” she suggested.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I don’t want that smell
on my foot, either,” I countered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I heard some rummaging
in the van.  Apparently, the greater good was in everyone’s nasal
self-interest, so everyone inside the van cooperated to find a Super Big Mart
plastic bag, which Easton brought back to me, reaching it to me from behind the
tail light.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You hold it open while
I shovel it into the bag,” I directed.  Easton slowly walked over to the head
end of the lump and held the mouth of the plastic bag open, fighting back his
gag reflex.  This, of course, left me on the business end of the dearly-departed
animal, so I gingerly pushed and scraped the black and white fur-pile into the
bag.  Just then, I saw a car at the top of the hill turning the corner to come
down from the upper parking lot.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Megan, can you take the
van down to the visitor’s center?  Easton and I will catch up in a few
minutes,” I called.  Megan nodded and moved quickly around over to the driver’s
seat, shifted into gear and sped away.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “C’mon, Easton,” I said,
pointing with the shovel toward the woods on the uphill side of the road. 
“Let’s go bury this or the smell is going to be here for weeks.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Easton, carrying the bag
with his arms outstretched in front of him as far as Easton-ly possible,
followed me up the hill a little way, far enough from the road to be
inconspicuous.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’ll dig a little
hole.  Wait for me to say it’s ready before you drop it in, okay?” I asked
Easton.  He nodded and I set to work digging the hole.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Digging with that little
camp shovel was more difficult than I had thought it would be.  It was so short
that I could get very little leverage with each turn, so it was taking longer
than I’d hoped.  Eventually, I had a little mound of dirt beside a hole about a
foot deep, which I figured would be deep enough to be an air-tight seal.  I
stood up to stretch my back and was about to have Easton put his smelly bundle
into the hole when I heard footsteps coming through the woods behind me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hey, who’s over there?”
came a stern voice which, unfortunately, I recognized.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Uh o---“ started
Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Will you <i>please</i>
stop saying that?” I hissed.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The footsteps behind me
quickened and before I knew it, Officer Duke was there by my side.  Again.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What are you two doing
here?” he asked roughly, looking down at the hole.  Suddenly, though, he caught
a whiff of our bag and, with watering eyes, asked “What is that?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “A skunk,” I answered
simply.  Was he a city-kid, too?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Officer Duke then turned
his eyes up to me and recognized me.  “Hey, aren’t you Dr. Higgins’ personal assistant
or something like that?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Absolutely not!” I shot
back, then calmed down quickly.  “Higgs was one of my missionary companions. 
That’s all.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Officer Duke paused,
looking from me to the hole, to Easton, and finally, to the bag-o’-skunk Easton
was holding.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well,” he said
tentatively, evidently not sure what to do.  I could see in his eyes that he
knew something was wrong, but apparently me being one of Higgs’ acquaintances
threw the whole universe of Church security into a lawless wasteland of
confusion, anarchy, and uncertainty.  “What’s this hole for?” he eventually
asked in Easton’s direction.  Why?  I’m not sure.  After all, I was the one
holding the shovel.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It’s for the skunk,”
Easton answered, holding out the plastic bag for him to investigate.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, no, that’s alright,”
Officer Duke said quickly, turning his face away from the bag slightly.  “So
what happened?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I sighed and explained
how we’d accidentally hit it with our van on the way down the hill and were
trying to get it buried before it stunk up the entire Hill Cumorah.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Probably a good idea,”
Officer Duke reluctantly agreed.  “But you all shouldn’t be up here digging
holes all over the place.  There are all kinds of power lines and water pipes
running everywhere.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You want us to leave it
here?” Easton asked, proffering the skunk bag.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            To my surprise, Officer
Duke answered, “Yeah, and you two go on.  I’ll take your package down over the
hill to the dumpster and double bag it.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Easton handed the bag to
Officer Duke.  He started down the hill while Easton and I went up to find the
path to the visitor’s center.  Just as we found the path and started on our way
around, we heard a sound from the direction Officer Duke had gone that stopped
Easton and I in our tracks.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Now, as I said before,
some things in this life are immediately identifiable without the need for
visual observance.  In this case, the sound we heard told us that I had not, as
it turns out, killed the skunk with the van after all.  Piper would be quite
happy to hear about that.  However, Officer Duke was going to need lots of
tomato juice and baking soda for the next few days, as the “dead” skunk had
been miraculously resurrected and taken its revenge out on him.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So, where is this
dance, anyway?” I said, watching Megan, Marianna, and Piper, all three arranged
in a circle around a less-than-patient looking Lauren, fixing things about her
hair and makeup which I obviously could not see.  Easton was sitting on a sofa
off to the side, clearly unimpressed with all the girl-stuff going on.  But
while Megan, Marianna, and Piper may have resembled the mice from the movie <i>Cinderella</i>,
Lauren, on the other hand, reminded me of the word “tolerance,” but in an
ice-pick-to-the-eyeball sort of way.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It’s in that stake
center across the road from the Palmyra Temple,” Megan answered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What do you think,
Dad?” Marianna asked, bouncing with excitement as Piper began snapping
pictures.  I would have guessed that she was supposed to be photographing
Lauren, but with the camera pointed in some very strange orientations, I didn’t
know what would actually come out.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I checked Lauren from
head to toe...actually, from toe to head; that way, I could conduct the
exercise without being immediately scorched by Lauren’s gaze.  Shoes, jeans
(not black), a pastel-colored T-shirt, hair pulled back.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And then it occurred to
me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wait a minute.  Where
did these clothes come from?” I asked.  I knew full well that Lauren’s current
wardrobe consisted of two colors: black and blacker.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well...” began Megan,
looking from Lauren to Marianna.  “Ray sent it over,” she chirped quickly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Ray?” I asked, angling
my head slightly.  I’d evidently heard her wrong, because, one, I didn’t think
we knew anyone named “Ray,” and two, she said it a little too quickly, as if
she didn’t want me to actually hear.  Therefore, I couldn’t just let it go.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Um,” paused Megan,
standing up straight and smiling sheepishly, “You know, Raylene.  Higgs’ wife.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            My eyes rolled back and
I instinctively began counting to myself.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Lauren took the
opportunity to escape and plopped down unceremoniously from her dais.  “It all
arrived on a private jet this morning from Utah,” said Lauren.  The worst part
about this comment was that I couldn’t actually tell for sure whether she was
telling the truth or just taunting me, because in this case, either option
seemed plausible.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan quickly grabbed
the upside-down camera from Piper and handed it to Marianna.  “Make sure to
take some pictures so we can send them to Raylene,” she said softly.  Then
Megan took me by the arm and led me up out of the great room into the foyer,
where the tuxedoed staff was just now wheeling out the last of the dinner
dishes.  “Now, don’t ruin this.  It’s not a date.  It’s just a dance.  Lauren
is...”  At this point, the customary word to describe the mood of most other
young women would have been “excited,” but Megan chose a more fitting term for
Lauren’s case, “...<i>intrigued</i> by the situation and I don’t want to keep
her from getting a chance to experience a normal, teenage activity.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What about all the
dances she skips at home?” I protested.  Why, out of all the people to finally
take an interest in, does she decide to go to a dance with the son of the guy
that perennially drives me nuts?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Will!  There are four
boys in our entire stake her age, and they don’t go to the dances, either,”
Megan answered.  “So we are going to get a grip so we don’t cause a scene!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The <i>Spousal
Translation Dictionary</i> again came into play.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Lauren approached us
from the foyer entrance followed by Marianna, Piper, and Easton.  Every now and
then, the cosmos tells me to stop and take note of something special.  This was
one of those moments.  Here we all were, our whole family together, in Palmyra,
our oldest daughter finally experimenting with the visible light spectrum.  I
figured it was a moment to relent and put my own feelings aside.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Marianna, let me see
the camera,” I said, and then asked one of the staff members (who I’d counted
was now on his fifth cart of dinner table stuffs) to take our family’s picture
in front of a travertine fountain adorning one of the side walls in the foyer.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Now, you have fun,
okay?” Megan said, cradling Lauren’s face in her hands as we moved toward the
front doors of the Suite.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes, mother,” Lauren
muttered through Megan’s grip.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Are you ready for me to
take you over?” I asked, fishing the van keys out of my pocket.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Actually, I’m just
going to walk over,” said Lauren, eyeing the keys suspiciously.  “It’s only
half a block and there’s a walkway over to the building.  I’m meeting Hyrum...”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I stifled a growl at
sound of that name.</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.45pt;line-height:200%'>“...by the door,
there,” she continued.  “Besides, I don’t want your reactions.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oops,” I thought to
myself.  Guess I need to work on that part of parenting.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And with that, Lauren
floated out the door, where the ever present doorman bowed her through. 
Marianna and Piper flew to the large window overlooking the lawn outside to
watch Lauren on her walk over to the church building where the dance was taking
place.  The sun was once again setting behind the hill where the Palmyra Temple
stood.  Lauren appeared on the walkway below to the squeals of Marianna and
Piper and a sigh from Megan.  Then she disappeared into a small copse of trees
between our hotel and the church building.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well,” I said, clapping
my hands together.  I’d formed a plan in my mind.  Something needed to be done
to make sure that this relationship with the enemy didn’t develop any further. 
“I’m going to go see if I can get some ice.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Ice?  I think there is
plenty already in the freezer,” I heard Megan say as I hurried out through the
ornate front doors.  I ran down the hallway and ducked into a stairwell, then
down to the ground floor.  However, instead of going through the lobby as we
usually did, I exited out through a doorway at the north end of the ground
floor hallway this time, then jogged around in a different direction to avoid
Marianna, Piper, Easton or Megan seeing me from the “Suite on high.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            After a few minutes of
creeping silently from the cover of one parked vehicle to another, I made it to
the edge of the line of tall trees Lauren had just disappeared into.  A quick
sprint through the trees put me behind a small brick outbuilding at the corner of
the stake center’s parking lot.  From there, I risked a peek toward the main building
to see whether I could find Lauren or not.  Knowing her, she was about to tap
me on the shoulder and ask me what I was doing there.  In fact, I checked
behind me, just to make sure.  Lucky for me, though, tonight she was
“intrigued,” as Megan had said, and consequently a little distracted, and I <i>could</i>
see her waiting under the porch overhang by one of the side entrances to the
stake center.  She was pacing slowly around the porch, looking toward the road
in front.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I felt a buzzing in my
back pocket, and reached back quickly to silence my phone.  It was a message
from Megan: “You still looking for the ice?” it read.  I turned the display off
and returned the phone to my back pocket.  I’d have to figure out how to deal
with Megan later.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Just then, a familiar
yellow Hummer turned into the parking lot from the road and stopped in front of
the porch where Lauren was waiting.  I imagined to myself the celebrity
treatment the Higginses must be accustomed to at events like this:</p>

<p class=Standard style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:200%'><i>“And look! 
Arriving just now, it’s Higgsy Higgins, being driven by his father, the
fabulous Dr. Hyrum LeGrand Higgins, of the Salt Lake City </i>Avenues<i>
Higginses.  He’s wearing a dashing jet-black Armani tuxedo, no doubt picked up
on their recent weekend stay in Milan.  Tonight, in true style, bringing to
life the ‘prince and the pauper’ story, he’s meeting his ‘plus one’ for
tonight’s gala, Lauren-someone-or-other, from the quintessentially common
mission field.”</i></p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>The passenger door opened and Higgs,
Jr. hopped out.  He, too, was wearing blue jeans and an orange T-shirt.  Lauren
stopped pacing.  Higgs, Jr. jogged over to where Lauren was waiting.  She said
something to him quietly, then turned to survey the woods I’d just emerged
from.  I ducked quickly back.  She might have been a little distracted, but she
was still not someone to trifle with.  Higgs, Jr. laughed, pointed his thumb
back at the yellow Hummer, and said something back to her.  They both laughed. 
I tightened my jaw as he gave her a little one-armed hug and then trotted over
to the door and opened it for her.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The yellow Hummer drove
off around the other side of the stake center.  Evidently, for that
ostentatiously oversized vehicle, it was easier for Higgs, Sr. to warm the
planet another couple of degrees by doing an entire circuit of the parking lot to
get back to the road rather than back up and turn around.  I squatted down
behind the outbuilding to wait for a few minutes.  Was I really going to go
in?  What exactly would I do?  Follow them around?  Leave tacks on chairs?  Put
a frog in someone’s drink?  I couldn’t just blend in with the crowd.  Honestly,
I didn’t look young enough anymore.  I continued to brainstorm for a few
minutes, but was unable to think of anything more concrete.  So, with spy movie
soundtrack music playing in my head, I shrugged and headed in to see what I
could see, hoping that perhaps an opportunity to sabotage this get-together
would arise.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Inside, I sidestepped
along the church-standard abrasive, scratchy burlap walls, which were pulsating
to the thudding bass of music coming from the gym.  I hugged a corner
(scratching off a couple layers of skin on the burlap in the process) to check
that the coast was clear.  Some kid with a blue “Proud to Be Crowd” T-shirt
slurped a drink from a water fountain, then disappeared around the far corner. 
I dashed down to a doorway close to the library.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Modern Church buildings
have something in common with Super Big Marts: wherever you go, when you walk
into one of them, you already know where things are, because every one of them
seems to be based on the same set of five or six floor plans.  Just as everyone
knows where to find the boloney at Super Big Mart, whether you visit Ogallala,
Nebraska or Pocatello, Idaho, you likewise already know where the bathrooms,
library, and Relief Society rooms are in a modern Church building.  So, when I
ducked into that room next to the library, I was happy to see that I’d found
exactly what I was looking for: the room with “the door.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Every male who has grown
up in the Church knows about “the door.”  (I was surprised to find out after
fifteen years of marriage that my wife had no inkling that “the door” even
existed.)  As an Aaronic Priesthood holder, when my ward’s building had grown
too small to contain all the needed classrooms, our Deacon’s quorum was
thrilled to be relegated to holding our priesthood class through “the door.” 
The door I am referring to is the door which held the ladder or stairway to
what I always termed the “Terrestrial Kingdom,” where all the ventilation and
plumbing pipes were hidden above the ceiling.  Imagine the excitement of a
twelve year old boy to be told by the Deacon’s quorum advisor, “Everyone up the
ladder to class.  Take this rope, tie it off on a pipe, and let’s pull up a few
folding chairs.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And, also due to my vast
experience with the Young Men’s program searching for basketballs squirreled
away on Sundays by “patient” bishoprics, I also knew the trick with a credit
card to open “the door.”  I closed the door quietly behind me and dashed up the
wooden stairs (bumped into a pipe, but the thudding of the music covered up the
sound...of me yelling, “Ouch!”  After all, my head was still sore from my
experience at the Whitmer Farm).</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            It was mostly dark up
there, with flashing strobes from the gym throwing long strips of light through
vent grates along the pipe-strewn walls.  I paused at a vent grate and looked
down into the gym.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            A mirror ball hung over
the center and bathed the boiling mass of decidedly casual outerwear.  Down on
the gym floor below, hundreds of kids, all with “Proud to Be Crowd” T-shirts
lived up to their namesake and...well...crowded the floor.  One kid even had a colorful
Lamanite headdress on.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Finally, I found
Lauren.  She was being led into the gym by Higgs, Jr. (him behind her, steering
her in by her shoulders).  Lauren was definitely not in her element here. 
Wide-eyed, her arms folded tightly, looking at everyone around her, she
followed his direction through the rowdy throng toward a corner where several
standard Church-issue round tables were set up.  He pulled a seat out for her
at one of the tables, which, now that I noticed it, was decorated differently
than the others.  It had a white tablecloth, a flower centerpiece, and two
place settings.  Lauren sat down and crossed her legs to match her arms.  Then,
Higgs, Jr. left her there!  Alone.  He just walked right out the side door
behind her.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Whoa!  He can’t leave
her there alone!  What’s he thinking?  That’s not how a man treats a lady!” I
spluttered to myself.  I stood up straight, bumped my head on another pipe,
then tripped over some dusty, insulated ductwork, and started back the way I’d
come.  I was going to go rescue Lauren and leave with her so she wouldn’t have
to sit there alone like that.  As I was thinking of it, it occurred to me that
this meant I wouldn’t actually have to do anything in order to break them up. 
I might even earn “hero dad” status in the process.  Perfect!</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Just as I was
approaching the stairway to go down, I saw the stairwell light up briefly from
below and then heard someone climbing the unfinished wooden stairs.  With wide
eyes, I tip-toed as quickly as I could back toward where I’d been watching
Lauren through the grate and ducked down behind the duct-work I had tripped
over.  Who could it be?  Could someone possibly have seen me peeking through
the vent grate?  Maybe whoever it was wouldn’t be able to see me amongst the
pipes up there since it was so dark.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Then it occurred to me,
these attics usually had lights.  How silly was I going to look to whoever it
was, squatting behind a pipe up here in the dark?  What if it were a chaperon? 
Expecting the lights to come on at any moment, I risked a peek from behind the
pipes I was hiding behind to see whether whoever-it-was was coming any closer. 
The flashing lights from the gym provided transient glimpses of a man threading
his way through the pipes in my direction, but I couldn’t see well enough to
know who it was.  However, I could tell that he was stopping every so often to
peer down through the grates, just as I had, onto the floor below.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The fact that he was
stopping every so often gave me a few more moments to plan.  The trouble was, I
couldn’t think of anything better to do than simply find a place to scrunch
myself in between more pipes.  Finally, I found a space on the floor where
someone had abandoned a wadded up volleyball net.  Since it looked softer than
the chipped wood subfloor prevalent everywhere else, I sat down on it and
craned my neck up as high as I dared to risk another look in the intruder’s
direction.  It appeared he was still looking down into the gym, so I decided to
take another look myself to see what was going on with Lauren---after all, it
had been a whole two or three minutes since I’d checked on her last!</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Lauren was still sitting
at the table by herself.  So, could it be Higgs, Jr. was up here with me?  But
that wouldn’t make any sense.  Why would he come up here just to watch her
through a vent grate?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I looked back at
Lauren.  First, she had her hands folded in her lap.  Then she moved her hands
to the table in front of her.  Then she shifted in her seat.  All the while,
she was looking around from the pumping crowd on the gym floor to the door
where Higgs, Jr. had left her a few minutes earlier.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Finally, the door Lauren
was watching opened and Higgs, Jr. returned.  That meant that the intruder up
there in the Terrestrial Kingdom with me was <i>not </i>Higgs, Jr., after all. 
This time, though, Higgs, Jr. was carrying a box, holding it above his head so
the bouncing kids on either side of him wouldn’t knock it out of his grip.  He
hurried over to the table where Lauren was sitting and sat down beside her.  He
handed Lauren the box, which she opened.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Out of the corner of my
eye, I saw the person up in the attic with me move away from the grate he’d
been looking through and head in my direction.  I ducked quickly.  The phone in
my back pocket buzzed.  I took it out, cradled it in my hands to block any
light from escaping, and checked.  It was another text from Megan: “Where are
you?”  Figuring that “getting ice” was probably not going to work (and after
all, it would be a lie, right?), I dashed off a reply, “Just taking a little
walk.  I’ll be back soon.”  I <i>had</i> actually been walking, right?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I peeked out again to
see where the attic intruder was now.  He was watching through another grate a
little closer to me.  Seeing that he wasn’t moving, I turned slowly back to
look down toward Lauren again.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The box Higgs, Jr. had
carried in was laying empty on the table beside her and she was now holding up
a handful of light blue flowers as if they were tainted with some sort of dire disease.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Klunk!  I heard a noise
off to my left.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Ow!” said the
intruder.  I involuntarily jerked my eyes there and recognized, thanks to the
voice, and to my annoyance, who it was that had come up the stairway after me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Higgs?!?” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Elder McGreg?” said
Higgs.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What are you doing
here?” I hissed at Higgs.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            He stepped over another
air-conditioning duct toward me and fell nearly on top of me.  I pushed him
back away from me a little more bruskly than might be considered polite.  He
brushed off his pant legs, smiling as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Er, well...”  Higgs
looked up at the ceiling some more, brushing dust off of his hands.  Finally,
he looked at his expensive watch and sat down beside me.  “I was told it was a
surprise.  Are you in on it, too?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Apparently not.  Who is
it for?” I asked irritably.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs paused for a
second, then checked his watch again.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well, here’s the
story,” he began.  “I don’t know if you’ve noticed or not, but we keep
‘accidentally’ running into you all around the area!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah, I’ve noticed.  I
think Lauren and your son have made sure of that,” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well, we’ve noticed
that you seem to be having trouble with Lauren.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Excuse me?” I
bristled.  “Lauren is fine.  We don’t need---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Bro, I don’t mean
trouble like you don’t know how to take care of her.  I mean trouble as in she
doesn’t want you to meddle in her life.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I gritted my teeth and
stared straight ahead.  How dare he make a judgment about something that I’m
smack in the middle of doing!</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            But, darn it, he was
right.  Lauren, as capable and independent as she was, still needed some
guidance, but Megan and I could always sense a sort of “keep your distance”
attitude from Lauren whenever we would try to offer advice of any kind.  We
felt like we knew what course would bring her the most happiness, and we tried
to steer her in that direction, but no matter how subtly we tried to do that,
she always seemed to resent it.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            But now it was worse:
even Higgs Higgins could tell.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Look, Bro,” he
continued, “Ray and I thought about it and want to help you guys.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I sat there stewing. 
What made him think that Megan and I didn’t know what to do?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “We haven’t been exactly
<i>encouraging</i> Higgsy to do anything, but, first off:  I think it’s safe to
say that he is intrigued by your daughter---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            There was that word
again: <i>intrigued</i>.  It probably wasn’t a coincidence that Megan had used
the same word.  Probably collusion between her and Raylene, was my guess.  Was
everyone in on this except me?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Stop there,” I
interrupted him.  “I don’t want to hear any more about that.  Is there anything
else going on that I’m not in on?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well, yeah.  Higgsy
said that he felt like he recognized something in Lauren that he used to feel
in himself:  a sense of not feeling like he fit in with the other youth at
church.  He said that he was thinking about paying his debt to Dave forward.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Who’s Dave?” I asked,
trying to sound frustrated rather than interested.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, sorry.  Dave is a
friend of Higgsy here at the pageant.  Dave sort of took Higgsy under his wing
at just the right time.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            So that was it.  Lauren
and the rest of us McCraigs were now the Higgins’ main charity project.  I was
about to protest, but the music in the gym suddenly stopped and someone started
fumbling with a microphone.  Higgs looked quickly down at his watch again.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “C’mon with me, Bro! 
I’ve got to get to my spot,” he said, standing up and moving off further down
the dark, pipe-laden corridor.  I stood up and started after him, reluctant to
miss whatever was going to happen.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay everybody,” said a
young voice over the speakers in the gym.  “Higgs wants to say something, now.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I heard cheers erupt
from the kids in the crowd, which gradually morphed into a repeating yell of
“speech, speech, speech.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs, Sr. turned to the
left up ahead of me and began making his way toward a dark corner as the chants
of “speech” from the kids below morphed into another round of cheers. 
Apparently, Higgsy had made it to the microphone.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hi!” came Higgsy’s
voice.  Everyone down below cheered again.  Upstairs, I finally caught up to
Higgs, Sr., who was trying to reach across the opening of a vertical descending
shaft.  It opened up in the floor at the end of the walkway.  It was a few feet
wide across the entire width of the walkway, but the opposite side of the shaft
was several feet away.  The shaft descended to the bottom of the floor below,
with vents along its shared wall with the gym all the way down, where a doorway
was outlined in light.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Thanks for giving me a
couple minutes here tonight,” said Higgs, Jr.’s voice.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs, Sr. was trying to
reach across the opening to the opposite side, where there was a thin cord
slung around a bolt on the wall.  Unable to reach it right off, he anchored
himself by clamping one hand onto a beam on our side of the opening, reaching
toward the cord with his other hand.  This made it so that he could reach a
little further than before, but the cord still dangled a few inches out of his
reach.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Here,” I hissed.  “I
can reach it.  I’ve got longer arms than you.”  One of my only advantages on
Higgs: I was an inch or two taller.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, no,” he whispered
back.  “I’ve got it...”  He swung his hand in wide arcs, trying to snag the
cord.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs, Jr.’s voice came
up from the gym speakers again: “So, I wanted to see if you all would help
me...Hang on---I’ve got it here...”  I could hear the sound of a plastic bag
being rustled opened caught by the mic.  “Here it is...”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs, Sr.’s fingers
were getting closer and closer, almost able to brush the cord.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Will you <i>please</i>
just let me get it?  You’re going to end up knocking it further away,” I
whispered.  It was driving me crazy.  What kind of person would insist on not
accepting any help?  (Me?  Of course, not...)</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Almost...got...it...”
Higgs, Sr. grunted.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Suddenly the crowd from
below in the gym began clapping.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh my heck!” Higgs, Sr.
exclaimed.  “It’s almost time!  I’ve got to get hold of that cord!  Do you have
a stick or something?” he asked, looking around on the ground, as if a stick would
have fallen into the attic somehow.  I got the feeling that he was
intentionally blocking my way to keep me from succeeding at something he
couldn’t do.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No!  But I can get it
myse----”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And that was when the
tips of Higgs, Sr.’s fingers made fleeting contact with the cord on the other
side of the shaft.  And, just as I’d predicted would happen, that was enough to
dislodge the cord from the bolt where it had been slung for “easy” access.  It
fell straight down the shaft, hugging the opposite wall.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well, who could’ve seen
that coming?” I commented sarcastically, looking down into the shaft at the
cord now hanging even further out of reach.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Lauren, I thought you
might like to be an honorary cast member in the pageant with us tomorrow
night.  So here’s a ‘Proud to be Crowd’ T-shirt for you,” Higgs, Jr. announced
below, to more cheers from the crowd.  “And here’s a crowd lanyard for you to
take back and hang in your room.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’ve got an idea!” said
Higgs, Sr., scrambling back the way we’d come, banging against pipes and air
ducts.  He stopped where I’d been hiding from him and picked up the volleyball
net I’d sat on, then came back to the edge of the shaft.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Here,” said Higgs, Sr.,
handing some of the tie-off ropes from the volleyball net to me.  “Tie these
onto something stable.  I’ll climb down the net to the floor below and be able
to pull the cord from there.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I thought that was
particularly brave of him to trust me to tie the net off securely.  Not that I
was bad at tying knots or anything.  It’s just that...I wouldn’t have trusted
his knots with my life.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What is so important
about that cord?” I asked, picking a sturdy looking girder to hitch my cords
to.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs, Sr. was busy
tying a tangle onto a flimsy looking pipe.  “It’s a surprise.  But it’s almost
time for me to do it, so hurry with your side.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As fraught as I
considered Higgs, Sr.’s plan to be with potential for disaster, I quickly and
capably tied a good, strong, taut-line hitch to anchor my side to the upright
steel girder I’d picked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs dropped the rest
of the volleyball net down our side of the shaft, opposite the wall where the
cord he was trying to reach hung.  Then he turned around and swung one leg over
the edge and began trying to fit his foot into the net as if it were a rope
ladder.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Though Higgs’ “knot”
squeaked ominously, miraculously, the net was holding his weight.  Still, as I
said, I couldn’t imagine myself ever trusting myself to his handiwork.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “See?  This is a
brilliant plan!” Higgs, Sr. exclaimed, smiling exultantly at me with his
perfect teeth.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What plan is that,
again?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’m going to climb all
the way down to the bottom and then walk across to pull the cord,” he answered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            He lowered himself a
couple more feet into the shaft.  Another chorus of “speech, speech, speech”
came again from the crowd in the gym.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Lauren’s voice suddenly
came over the speakers: “Um, thanks, I think.  But what, exactly, do I have to
do?”  Lauren was never a fan of being in front of a crowd.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            There was some banging
as they exchanged the microphone, and then Higgs, Jr.’s voice took over: “The
first thing you have to do is put on the costume!”  Everyone cheered.  “Give
her the headdress!  Wait, turn it around the right way...  Okay, start up the
music!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The booming sub-woofery
music started up again, seeming even louder than before.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Have I mentioned how
disastrous I thought Higgs, Sr.’s plan for getting down to the bottom of that
volleyball net seemed?  He was fidgeting with his left foot, trying to get it
out of one of the net’s squares, but the net seemed determined to hang onto the
overly rugged tread of his designer work shoes.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What’s wrong?” I called
down into the shaft.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs looked up, still
smiling, but with one eyebrow raised in frustration.  “My foot might be stuck!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            He kept trying to shake
it loose, but the net only seemed to be working itself tighter around his
foot.  He looked backwards at the cord and tried a last-ditch effort to reach
it with one of his hands again, but this only had the effect of forcing him to
stretch out his free foot in order to keep balanced...which, as might could be
guessed, worsened the situation even further.  Higgs’ weight suddenly twisted
around his stuck foot, bringing him upside down with one arm plunged into the
net up to his shoulder, his free foot dangling toward the center of the shaft,
and his other arm flailing to find anything solid to steady himself.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Um, I think I’m stuck,
Bro,” his voice called from below.  I couldn’t believe it, but he was chuckling
to himself, too.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I shook my head and
rolled my eyes.  “You think?” I asked sarcastically.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah, but we’ve got to
get that cord and pull it at the end of this song!” said Higgs.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Why?” I asked again.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It’s a surprise.  Can
you climb down and get it?” he asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You want <i>me</i> to
climb down over you and pull that cord?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah, but quick!  The
song is almost over,” he said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            To this day, I don’t
know what made me do it.  I don’t know why I didn’t just run back to the
stairway, run through the hallways to the door below us, open it and pull that
mysterious cord.  I attribute it to some mind trick Higgs, Sr. played in order
to convince me to follow him.  Whatever it was, I went ahead and lowered myself
over the edge after him.  At first, I thought I was doing pretty well.  I felt
pretty sure-footed in my Super Big-Mart shoes and managed to climb down to
where he hung faster than I’d thought I would.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay, go ahead and put
your foot down to where my free hand is and I’ll guide it into a rung in the
net,” said Higgs as I started to negotiate the climb around him.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Make sure it’s in a
spot by the edge of the net.  Those seem to be the most stable,” I called.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs flailed around and
found my foot.  I held my breath.  As far as luck was going, I figured we were
already past our limit at this point, and well into debt, again (and most
likely with a higher rate of interest).  But wonder of wonders, Higgs actually
managed to get my foot into a spot where it seemed to be holding my weight. 
So, with one leg over the top of Higgs (which was, ironically, his bottom), I
started to lower the rest of myself down and around him.  And this is where the
loan shark who held our luck-debt was tipped off by his friend, karma, who was
none too happy that I was there spying on my daughter.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Remember the “knot”
Higgs, Sr. had tied?  Only in the loosest (pardon the pun) sense do I use the
word “tied” to describe what Higgs, Sr., did to his side of the net anchorage. 
Suddenly, one side of the volleyball net fell out from under us.  Unfortunately,
that side happened to be the one Higgs had just put my foot into, where my
weight had been resting just as I’d started lowering myself down and around
him.  Now, I found myself swaying back and forth, upside down, holding onto
what was left of the net below me to keep myself from tumbling another seven or
eight feet onto the floor below.  From where I hung, that floor looked very
hard, and as I said, my head was still sore.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What happened?” Higgs,
Sr. asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I should have thought
before answering.  But I didn’t.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What happened?!?  I’ll
tell you what happened,” I spluttered, trying to get my other leg untangled
from the net above Higgs.  “That tangle you slopped together up there just came
undone!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well how do you know it
was my side and not yours?” he asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The name of my knot was
the ‘taut line hitch.’  What was the name of yours?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Knots have names?  I
don’t know whether it has a specific name, per se...” he said, trailing off.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “And now we’re stuck
here!  And with that music playing so loud, no one will be able to hear us for
hours!” I yelled.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs was quiet for a
few seconds.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well, maybe the rope on
my side broke.  It didn’t necessarily come untied, Elder McGreg,” he said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We hung there in silence
for a few more seconds.  Silent, that is, except for the booming music coming
from the gym.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Elder McGreg, your butt
is lighting up,” said Higgs.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            My phone was buzzing
again.  Megan was probably...no, definitely suspicious by now.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It’s just my phone. 
Can you reach it?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Um, yeah,” he grunted,
twisting us both around as he fumbled through folds of the volleyball net to
reach into my back pocket and pull out my phone.  “It looks like it’s a text
from your wife.  She’s asking where you are.  Oh!” he said suddenly, almost
hyperventilating with excitement, “Dude!  I know what to answer!  I’ll send
it.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hold on...,” he said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No---Higgs, what are
you saying?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Almost done...” he
said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I want to know what you
are sending---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Got it!  There!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What did you send?” I
asked more vehemently.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I told her you’d run
into me and we got to talking and lost track of the time,” said Higgs.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I snorted.  “Great!  Now
I’m definitely in trouble.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Why?”  Higgs sounded
honestly confused.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You mean to say that
you can tell Lauren is bothered by Megan and me meddling in her life, but you
have absolutely no idea why Megan would positively know something was up from
what you wrote in that text?” I started slowly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What?” he asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I took a deep breath. 
“Because I would never---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I heard my phone buzz in
Higgs’ hand.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Why did your wife just
write, ‘Who is this?’” he asked.  I rolled my eyes.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            After a few deep breaths
to calm myself down, I looked up and behind me (in actuality, down and behind
me since I was still upside down).  Stretching out my left arm, I was about six
inches away from being able to reach the cord on the opposite wall.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Higgs, push yourself
away from the wall so I can swing over to get the cord,” I said.  Using half an
ankle-turn, Higgs, Sr. managed to push us both away from the wall.  I swung my
arm out trying to grab the cord.  I was a few inches closer, but not quite
there.  We both fell back to the wall with a painful thud.  Higgs pushed away a
second time with a grunt.  Closer, but not quite.  A bigger---and
proportionally more painful---thud.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Stop!” Higgs, Sr.
croaked.  “I can’t breathe...gimme a second.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We both panted for a few
seconds, the rhythm gradually slowing.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Let’s try pushing
toward the cord again,” I said.  “But this time, we’ll push together.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Awesome!” said Higgs,
Sr.  “On three?  Ready...One...two---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hang on,” I called. 
“Is it ‘one, two, three, push?’  Or ‘one, two,’ and then push on ‘three?’” 
That always confused me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It’ll be, ‘One, two,
three, push,’” he answered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Just then, the song in
the gym came to an end.  The music stopped.  There was some tentative
clapping.  Then Higgs, Jr.’s voice came over the PA system: “Uh, well,
something was supposed to happen there.  Anyone listening?  Pull the cord,
Dad.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Ready?  One...two...three....”
said Higgs.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            This would have been a
great place for this episode to end with me using my free leg to push with
Higgs, Sr., and finally grabbing hold of the cord, and causing some magic
surprise to happen, which I’d as yet not been able to discover.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            However, that wouldn’t
be my life, would it?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I could tell that our
final push had been a doozy, and that my momentum was going to get me to the
cord.  I could also tell that I’d have plenty of time to grab it and then
pull.  But before I could reach the cord, apparently that loan shark of luck
and his thugs decided to hit us up for what we owed them.  The volleyball net
had reached its limit, and instead of swinging across the shaft to the cord, we
suddenly began to tumble down the shaft.  Finally, as if in slow motion, I
reached the bottom of the shaft first (still upside down), my feet banging hard
against the door.  The next thing I knew, a big ball of Higgs, Sr. came to rest
on top of me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Elder McGreg, are you
dead?” came Higgs, Sr.’s muffled voice.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Just then, a bright ray
of light appeared...exactly over my head...slowly growing wider and wider.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hello?” I heard a boy
saying.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hello!” said Higgs,
Sr.  “We’re stuck!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I squinted against the
brightness coming in from the gym.  The boy opening the door wore one of the
“Proud to Be Crowd” T-shirts and was holding a plateful of cake.  Behind him,
hundreds of similarly dressed youth were turning in our direction.  The kid
with the cake turned his head sideways and looked in at us.  Then he turned and
called out, “Hey Higgs, it’s your dad!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And then my mind
cleared.  I was lying on top of the end of that stupid cord.  What’s more, I
had enough movement in one arm to pull it.  And, I really wanted to know what
was so important about pulling that stupid cord that was worth all that pain,
and now humiliation.  So I reached out and pulled it as hard as I could.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            A sheet of plastic tore
away from the ceiling in the gym, and thousands of balloons began to spill out
over the crowd.  For a moment, everyone’s attention was drawn away from Higgs,
Sr. and me, crumpled in a heap at the bottom of the shaft.  Kids were batting
balloons at each other as they poured down from the ceiling.  Some of the more
obnoxious kids in the middle were stomping on them as fast as they could.  Some
of the balloons even floated over to the doorway by us.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            One of them floated in
front of me and I saw, written in black magic marker on the side of it:
“Congratulations, Lauren---newest member of the crowd!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Finally the last of the
balloons trickled down.  The animated kids outside the door were now scooping
up balloons and swatting them at each other, screaming and laughing
cheerfully.  Suddenly, they all fell quickly silent.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Uh-oh,” I said.  I had
a high degree of confidence in my guess at what had caused the sudden change in
mood.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What?” asked Higgs,
Sr.  “What’s happening?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’m in trouble,” I
answered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Sure enough, the crowd
in the gym began to slowly part.  Emerging serenely from the midst of the
crowd, Lauren glided over to the door through the layer of balloons covering
the floor.  She knelt down in front of me and smiled, then held her phone out
to me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It’s Mom,” she said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>Dear Megan,</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>I woke up early and decided to go
for a walk down at the Hill Cumorah in order to think.  I’ll be back in time
for our temple appointment.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>Love,</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>Will</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I folded the note so
that it couldn’t be seen without prising it open, wrote “Mrs. McCraig” on the
outside, hurried through the suite’s front door past the bowing doorman, and
then hurried down the stairs.  With all other leads for getting my family a
walk-on role in the pageant having been exhausted, I decided that it was time
for desperate measures.  And that was my mission this morning.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Good morning,
Sunshine,” came a wry voice from the front desk as I entered the lobby.  It was
Carrie-Willow, reading a book.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Good morning.  Are you
Lisa, Bob or Leroy today?” I asked.  She laughed, but kept reading.  I kept
walking toward her desk, getting the note for Megan ready to hand over to her. 
I got to the desk with the note in my hand and saw that her tag read, “Ian”
today.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The cover of her book
was worn and blank, with some gold flecks of words on the spine.  I turned my
head sideways to try and read the title on the spine but still couldn’t make it
out.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So, what are you
reading?” I finally asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Nothing,” she answered
simply, as if I were being dense to ask such a question.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Still, she seemed
determined to keep reading.  I started drumming my fingers on the counter,
trying to hint that I was waiting for her to look up at me.  I was starting to
wonder: does she make every guest wait for her to be ready to help them, or was
it just me?  Strangely, it didn’t bother me as much as I would have guessed it
would.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Are you sure?” I asked,
trying to hint that I was waiting for her attention.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Um, yeah” she said,
leaving the “duh!” off in word only.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay,” I said slowly. 
Actually, this was good.  She liked to read.  This could work out for me and my
goal to give someone a Book of Mormon during this trip.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Finally, she snapped the
book shut, put it down, and looked up at me smiling.  “Done!  What can I do for
you?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Three things,” I
began.  “Are you working tomorrow morning?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            She gave me a confused
look, but answered, “Yeah.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Great!” I said.  It
would be the perfect time to give her a Book of Mormon.  “Next, can I get a
ride in the hotel shuttle to the Hill Cumorah?”  She nodded.  “And finally, can
I leave this note for my wife with you?”  I proffered the note toward her.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            She reached over and
took the note, then raised it into the air above her head in an attempt to read
it.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “In trouble, huh?” she
asked, turning it to look at it by different angles.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Just getting an early
start this morning.  This is so she’ll know where she can catch up with me if
she needs to.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Carrie-Willow called Bob
to pick me up with the shuttle.  He dropped me off in the parking lot in front
of the Hill Cumorah visitor’s center.  Since it was now the first day of the
pageant, a steady stream of people was already going into and out from the
front doors.  Over through the windows of the semi-circular bay at the front
center of the building, I could see a group of twenty or so visitors seated
around the Christus statue we had visited yesterday.  Off to the south, other
people were already weaving ropes, laying blankets, and taping signs to the
green Sunday-School seats in the field below the ten-level stage where the
pageant would be performed this evening.  The long row of international flags
down by the road were snapping in the stiff breeze that was blowing from the
south, so I had my doubts that some of their “my spot!” reservation methods
would remain secure.  One small, desperate bunch, though, was already sitting
in the center of the front row.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wow,” I said to
myself.  “They <i>really</i> want a good view.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Separating myself from
the growing crowds, and looking wistfully at the Gadianton Bathrooms, dreading
what I knew I had to do next, I headed up the driveway to the left of the
visitor’s center toward the trees that surrounded the Zion’s Camp trailer
park.  I waved as nonchalantly as I could to the Officer in the guard shack to
indicate I was passing through.  This time it wasn’t Officer Duke.  This new
guard hastily exited the shack and challenged me with, “Excuse me, sir.  This
area is closed to the public.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’m here to see Higgs,”
I said, slowing.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’m sorry, sir, I don’t
know who that is,” he said, placing himself between me and the pedestrian
entrance to Zion’s camp, forcing me to come to a complete stop.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I rolled my eyes and
sighed.  “Doctor...” I said through gritted teeth, “...Higgins.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The officer eyed me
suspiciously.  “Do you have an invitation?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Not formally.”  Another
sigh.  “We were mission companions.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh,” he said slowly
while nodding.  “They told me about you.  Alright, then.  Sorry for the
trouble, sir.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I walked on through as
quickly as I could, unusually aware of how I was moving---I didn’t want to look
like I was getting away with anything, but also wanted to look confident.  It
was a literal balancing act.  When I’d gotten half a dozen steps past him, I
heard him say softly to himself:  “I would’ve thought he’d dress nicer as an
Assistant to the Twelve.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Grinding my teeth, I
kept on going and didn’t stop or look back till I’d reached the biggest trailer
in the park.  I knocked.  Probably two or three...or ten...knocks more than
would be usually polite, then stood back and took some deep breaths.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs, Sr. opened the
door.  He was wearing his usual monogrammed white polo shirt, white shorts,
crew-length socks and expensive shoes.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Elder McGreg!  Come
in!” he said, munching on a bagel.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I walked past him into
the trailer.  Unsurprisingly, it looked even bigger and more ornate on the
inside.  Large recliners which couldn’t possibly exist in that space sat
comfortably at the front.  A polished mahogany table was set for breakfast
(same paltry fare as in our hotel room, it looked like).</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I was just sitting here
having a little breakfast.  Have a seat and eat something with me, Bro,” said
Higgs, pushing out a chair for me as he picked up a remote control to turn the
news off on the 500 channel satellite television (60-inch class).  “There are
extra plates in that cabinet there,” he said, pointing to a wall of custom
built cabinets.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I shook my head and sat
down beside him.  “No, no thanks, Higgs.  I just wanted to talk to you for a
minute....”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’m so sorry about last
night---” he said quickly.  “I can’t believe that net broke like that.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It didn’t break, it
came undone,” I muttered.  “No, wait, that’s not what I wanted to talk about. 
It’s just that I was hoping you might be able to---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Get you guys good seats
for the pageant tonight?  Hey, don’t worry.  I can get you guys great seats. 
After all, I’m Father Lehi this---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, Higgs, wait a
second.  Let me finish.”  I took a deep breath and summoned all the humility I
could.  “I was wondering...if you could...you know...” and here I did the
proverbial mumble of “...get us into a crowd scene in the pageant tonight?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’m sorry, what?” he
asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I said...I wondered if
you could...mumble mumble us mumble pageant tonight.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “One more time, dude,”
said Higgs.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Finally, I dropped my
head and sighed.  “Can you get us a into a crowd scene of some kind in the
pageant tonight?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            There.  It was done. 
I’d come to bow down to his highness and begged a boon of him.  And now, it was
up to him as to whether he would deign to grant it to a lowly nobody like
myself.  But, if this was going to be the perfect Palmyra vacation for my
family, then this was the only option I had left, and it was a price I felt I
needed to pay.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs’ face turned
piteous as he said, “Dude, I’m sorry.  The deadline to put names in was last
week.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I continued looking at
him imploringly for a moment.  He looked back at me as if he, for once, didn’t
know what to say.  I half wanted to ask him if he knew a guy named Gadianton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’m really sorry, Bro”
he said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Back at the hotel, Megan
surprised me by showing she had received my note by giving me a hug when I
arrived at our room.  Breakfast had already been cleared by the waiters and
Megan had spread a large assortment of temple name cards in its place.  Piper
sat at one end of the table in her bright orange shirt again, stirring the
cards Megan had just placed in meticulous columnar order into chaotic swirling
spirals.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Which ones am I looking
for again, Mom?” Piper asked.  Then, seeing me appearing in the doorway, “Oh,
hi Dad!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan glanced down at the
table and picked up a card, then walked it over to Piper and, pointing at it,
said, “See these little boxes with the word ‘baptism’ in them?  We need to make
a pile with cards where those baptism boxes are empty.  We’ll make it right...”
Megan shuffled a space into existence and put the first card of the pile in the
middle of that space.  “...here.  Got it?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay, Mom,” said Piper,
and she began looking through the cards.  “But what do I do if that box already
has something in it?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Put them in this container,”
said Megan, putting a plastic bin on the table beside her.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan came back to the
doorway where I leaned.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Where are the other
kids?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “They’re in the living
room playing a video game.  Do you want to go play with them for a little while? 
Your temple appointment isn’t until eleven.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, maybe I’ll help
Piper for a little while since I won’t see her while the rest of us are in the
temple.  Which reminds me, where are you and Piper going to go during that
time?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan shrugged and
turned to Piper.  “I hadn’t really thought much about it.  Piper, where do you
think you’d like to go while Dad and the other kids are in the temple?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Piper put her finger to
her chin as if in deep thought.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hmmm,” she started.  “I
think, maybe, I want to go to the Sacred Grove again.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I spent a little while
sorting temple cards with Megan and Piper.  Every now and then we’d try to
pronounce a strange name from the 1800s we’d never heard before.  Piper
suggested we try to find names we’d like to have as our own.  Piper picked
“Electra” and I picked “Austin.”  Then, I did some reconnaissance to the living
room and found that all three older kids (including Lauren, to my surprise)
were already dressed and ready for the temple.  And so, after getting myself
ready, two false starts from the parking lot (first for forgotten recommends
and then for forgotten baptism cards), we headed off to the Sacred Grove to
drop Megan and Piper off.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wow, look at the sky,”
said Megan, peering out the front window.  Since I’d been out earlier this
morning, it appeared that the stiff breeze I had observed earlier had blown in
ahead of a front of thick, dark clouds.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What do you think? 
Should we take you and Piper back to the hotel?” I asked, looking at the clouds
with Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Noooo!  I wanted to go
back to the Sacred Grove!” Piper squealed.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I know, Piper, but if a
storm is coming, then it can be dangerous in there around trees with wind and
lightning,” I said, looking at Piper’s tear-welling eyes.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I think we’ll be
alright,” said Megan.  “If it starts to storm, we can head to the welcome
center, and then I can call that blue-haired girl at the hotel---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Carrie-Willow?” I
asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I thought her name tag
said ‘Julie’ when I saw it,” said Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, it was ‘Ian,’”
Marianna piped up from her seat.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Leroy,” said Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Bob,” said Lauren, in a
tone that clearly indicated that hers was the final and authoritative answer.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Whatever her name is,
we’ll call her if we need to,” said Megan.  “Besides, I know how much you
wanted this to be the high point of the trip with you and the older kids.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah,” I said.  “The
more time in the temple for them, the better...”  But what I had really been
hoping for was to be destroyed with my wife and family in the Nephite temple this
evening.  Oh well...I guess it wasn’t meant to be.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We dropped Megan and
Piper off at the Smith Farm welcome center and then headed to the temple.  We
arrived there just as a car with a Utah license plate near the sidewalk was
backing out.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Front row!” said Easton
in exultation.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I parked and turned the
key to the off position, heard a door open, followed by an “Uh-oh” from
Marianna.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What’s wrong?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Uh, Angel just jumped
out,” she answered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Angel?  What’s he doing
with us?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Piper was holding him,
but she told him to ‘stay’ when she got out at the Sacred Grove,” said Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Why did he come with us
in the first place?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I don’t know.  Maybe
because Piper didn’t want to leave him alone in the hotel room?” proffered Marianna.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well, where did he go?”
I asked, looking all around and under the van.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I think he headed
toward the temple,” answered Lauren, pointing up the sidewalk toward the front
entrance.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wonderful,” I muttered
under my breath.  My hand went to the phone in my pocket, but, against my first
inclination, I decided not to bother Megan with this problem.  I could handle
this myself, I resolved.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay, let’s go see if
we can find him,” I said, closing my door.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We walked up the
sidewalk, my tie flapping in the now gale-force wind over my shoulder, slapping
against my upper back.  All along the sidewalk, up to the entrance doors of the
Palmyra temple, we peered intently into bushes and flower beds for Angel’s gray
and white stripes.  After two back-and-forths along the sidewalk, I called the
kids up to the entrance.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Do you think he went
into the temple?” yelled Marianna above the wind.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Slowly, and as one, all
of our heads turned toward the elaborate glass doors of the Palmyra temple,
decorated to resemble trees within the Sacred Grove.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Five bucks...” started
Lauren again, but then for some reason, she didn’t complete the certainly-true
statement I’m sure she was about to voice.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Knowing my luck
lately...we’d better go check,” I said, heading toward the doors.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Using my best
commando-style hand motions, I silently sent Easton and Marianna to one side of
the coatroom to check for Angel.  Lauren and I checked the other side.  We
moved inward in order to flush him out if he were hiding, say, in someone’s lunch
bag.  As it happened, we met at the other end of the coat racks without finding
him.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What do we do now,
Dad?” whispered Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well...” I started,
weighing the options in my head.  Which was more important?  Finding Angel?  Or
making sure my kids had a good experience in the temple today?  My eyes went
back and forth as if one option were on the left and the other on the right.  I
looked once more at all the kids standing in front of me waiting for an answer.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Let’s go ahead and head
in,” I answered softly.  “Angel is probably hiding in the woods or something
and will probably be waiting under our van by the time we get out.  Who has the
temple cards?” I asked, looking towards Marianna and Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I do,” said Lauren,
holding up a group of several paper-clipped stacks of name cards.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We entered the inner
doors separating the coatroom from the rest of the temple and approached the
recommend desk.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Do animals have to have
a recommend to go into the temple?” Easton asked the white-haired man behind the
recommend desk.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Easton!” I scolded
quickly but softly as Lauren handed our recommends to the man.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            It was a nice time in
the temple with the kids.  All the while we were in there, though, I could hear
the wind whistling loudly outside.  Part-way through our session, rain started
pelting against the windows in sheets.  Lightning flashes and thunder appeared
to flash and boom closer and closer together.  I even thought I heard a
helicopter fly low over the temple at one point.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            When we were done, being
the first one back to the foyer, I looked out the west window toward the Sacred
Grove.  <i>Piper and Megan are over there, </i>I thought to myself with some
concern.  Then I noticed several things.  First, it was very dark out.  So dark
that it appeared to be nighttime, despite being only around five or six in the
afternoon.  Second, there were lots of flashing red and blue lights visible
through that window looking out toward the Sacred Grove.  And third, a
harried-looking older man was shuffling toward me from the direction of the
temple office holding a yellow sticky note.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Are you Brother
McGreg?” he asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I nodded that I was, but
returned to look toward the Sacred Grove.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “The Sacred Grove office
is calling for you,” he said next, tugging at the elbow of my white shirt.  I
impatiently followed him into the office where a white, cordless phone receiver
was laying on the desk.  I could hear lots of active chatter and noise coming
from the earpiece.  The temple worker picked up the phone and said, “Hello?
...Yes, I’ve found him.  Would you like to speak with him now? ... Okay...”  He
handed the phone to me with a worried look on his face.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I whispered “Thanks,”
and took the phone with me a few feet from the desk.  “Hello?” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Will!” shouted Megan. 
In the background I could hear garbled radio chatter.  It sounded like she was
standing right beside a police car with radio traffic being blasted over
loudspeakers behind her.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Megan?  I can hardly
hear you.  What’s going on?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “We were way back in the
back of the Sacred Grove by all the oldest trees when the storm started getting
really bad, so I told Piper to run toward the welcome center.  She got so far
ahead of me that I lost sight of her.  When I got here to the welcome center,
she wasn’t here!  And she still hasn’t gotten here, and it’s been almost an
hour since we got separated!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I peered out from the
office area toward the big west window and saw Lauren, Marianna and Easton all
looking toward the Sacred Grove as another fire engine screamed by on the
highway between us.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “We’ll be right over,
Megan.  We’ll find her.  Love you,” I said quickly.  I pressed the hang-up
button on the phone receiver and handed it quickly to the temple worker, who
looked expectantly at me for an explanation.  I whispered another quick “Thank
you” to him, which I know must have disappointed him, but, given the
circumstances, we needed to get going.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I corralled the kids
outside and down to the van.  The weather had changed somewhat.  Most of the
rain had stopped, but the wind, lightning and thunder continued.  After
ensuring that no cats were under the van, I started the engine.  Just then, a
spectacular flash of lightning blinded and deafened us all at once. 
Reflexively looking to where it had struck, I saw sparks flying from the
steeple of the temple and saw all the exterior and interior lights go out,
followed a couple seconds later by a deep thud on the ground somewhere behind
us.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Everyone okay?” I asked
into the darkened van.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I counted three muttered
“yeahs.” Rather than wait for power to come back on to the parking lot lights,
I started backing out of our parking space, hoping to get over to the Sacred
Grove as soon as possible; but before I’d completely backed out of our parking
spot, I heard a klunk and could tell that we’d backed into something.  It
wasn’t as big as a car, and not as immovable as a pole or wall, but I still
felt something being knocked backward by our back bumper.  I checked the
rear-view mirror.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What is that?” I
muttered to myself.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The parking lot lights
were beginning to flicker back on following the lightning strike.  Following my
lead, all the kids turned to look out the back window.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It’s a trumpet!” said
Marianna.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And indeed it was.  The
bell of a trumpet was pointed skyward just behind our van.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            From that day forward, I
had one of the best “truth or fiction” game entries ever:  I once backed my van
into the Palmyra Temple’s Angel Moroni.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Luckily, Lauren managed
to get a picture of Easton and I pulling Moroni’s gold-and-lightning-blackened
head across the parking lot by the bell of his long, heraldic trumpet to the
curb opposite our parking space.  (Best. Profile. Pic. Ever!)</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Having cleared the way,
we drove out of the temple parking lot, glimpsing the two older ladies from
Super Big Mart and the Whitmer Farm watching us from the temple sidewalk.  Then
we headed over to the Sacred Grove as fast as we could, me explaining to the
others what had happened to Piper along the way.  And, as we neared the Sacred
Grove,  I prayed.  I prayed more profoundly and hopefully than I’d ever prayed before
that Piper would be safe, and that we would be able to find her quickly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            When we reached the
Sacred Grove, there were siren lights flashing from three fire trucks, eight
police cars, a SWAT van, two local news crews, and a helicopter circling
above.  Completing the chaotic scene was the headless Moroni standing in the
spotlights across the highway on top of the Palmyra Temple.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Because of all the
emergency and news vehicles, a traffic director motioned for me to turn toward
the nether regions of the parking lot, far away from the Sacred Grove welcome
center.  I tried to yell out my window that the lost girl they were there for
was my daughter, but there was too much noise with the wind, and the guy just
blew his whistle at me and kept directing me away.  As soon as the van jerked
to a halt, we all bailed out into the flying dust and leaves and bolted toward
the welcome center.  Passing by the entrance to the parking lot, a set of
bright headlights on a big yellow Hummer turned in from the highway.  Of
course, the traffic director reflexively stepped aside and pointed it directly
into the closest parking spaces (Higgs took two!) next to the welcome center.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Coming through the
doors, there was a hubbub of activity. Elder Rindlisbacher, sitting at a desk
in the side office, had two or three manuals (none of them red this time)
opened in front of him and had a phone up to his ear.  A couple folding tables
were set up in the main room of the welcome center, around which several police
officers and fire-fighters with dripping raincoats were pointing at maps
together and talking on handheld radios.  At the end nearest me, Higgs, Sr. was
nodding as the largest and most intimidating looking officer barked something
at him and, of course, Officer Duke.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I scanned the room and
found Megan, her head buried in her hands, sitting at a table near the water
fountain.  The sister missionaries we had seen on our earlier visit here were
sitting on either side of her trying to comfort her, one of them holding a box
of tissues.  I pulled Lauren, Marianna, and Easton with me toward her and was
halfway there when I heard Officer Duke exclaim, “You again?” followed quickly
by Elder Rindlisbacher: “You didn’t bring that cat of yours again, did you?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Marianna answered
blankly, “No, no.  He’s still in the temple.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We reached Megan, where
the sister missionaries scooted aside to let us sit down beside her.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I put my head close to
hers and asked, “Are you okay?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I’m so sorry, Will,”
she said through her tears.  “I just couldn’t keep up with her.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Everything is going to
be okay,” I said, reaching my arm around her shoulders to give her a sideways
hug.  “Just keep...”  I swallowed, closed my eyes, and said, “...praying.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Are you the father?” a
rough voice asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I looked up and saw the
tall, burly SWAT team leader towering over me.  He was wearing a dark blue
Kevlar helmet, a pair of night-vision goggles pulled up over his eyes, and an
earpiece radio in his left ear.  The bulletproof vest he was wearing only
served to add to his overall “presence” as the largest man in the room.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes,” I said, nodding.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Do you have a photo of
your daughter that we can use during the search?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I looked at Megan,
squinting as if trying to remember whether we had any pictures of her.  And
then it occurred to me.  We had just taken a picture of the whole family
yesterday!  “Do you have the camera?” I asked Megan quickly.  She nodded,
reached for her purse, pulled it out and handed it to me.  I turned it on and
brought up the most recent photo---our family standing together in front of the
fountain before the dance last night.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “She’s the short one in
the middle with the bright orange shirt,” I said, handing the camera to the
SWAT team leader.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Do you know what she’s
wearing today, then?” he asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Uh, she’s wearing the
same shirt,” I said, feeling my face turn red.  He looked at me as if to say,
“Wouldn’t a <i>good</i> parent make sure their daughter put on clean clothes
every day?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Do you have a printout
of this photo?” he asked, as if it only made sense that we should have a print
of this for just this occasion.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, this was taken
yesterday,” I explained, suddenly feeling like I was back in elementary school
and was explaining to Mrs. Sullivan that I had forgotten my homework.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The SWAT leader
frowned.  “I’ll get my people to print it out for us so we can hand copies to
the search team.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Search team?  “I’d like
to help search,” I said quickly.  After all, I’d rather be doing something than
sitting here waiting.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I don’t think so,” he
said, eyeing me up and down.  “It’s not safe in there and we don’t want to have
to worry about our own team members.  Doctor Higgins, let’s go start the
search.”  Then he turned and headed toward the door, followed by Higgs, Sr.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I looked at myself.  I
guess I was still in a dress-shirt and tie, but still, I felt capable of
walking through the woods to search for my daughter.  I looked at Higgs, who
looked over at me, now seeming to understand what was going through my head at
a time like this.  He nodded, pulled the hand-held radio from the belt of his
own tactical pants and handed it to me on his way out.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Don’t worry, Bro.  We’ll
find her,” he said, then followed the rest of the search team out the door.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Resigned to only being a
civilian listener, I put the radio on the table in front of our family and
started wandering back and forth.  We heard the SWAT team leader announce to
all other search teams that they were looking for a nine year old little girl
named Piper McGreg wearing a bright orange shirt.  If I were a pacing person,
it would probably be appropriate to say that I was pacing as we listened to
additional radio calls back and forth between search team groups.  One group
would report in saying they were starting grid whatever, another would report
that they were finishing grid something-else.  Occasionally, we’d hear about a
large tree limb blocking a path or a whole tree uprooted by the wind.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I
kept...pacing...habitually looking at my phone every now and then to see the
time.  Simultaneously, I would also see my step-count increasing.  Three
thousand....Seven thousand...Eleven thousand steps.  Lauren, Marianna and
Easton started out listening to the radio calls.  Eventually, Marianna and
Easton both fell asleep.  Lauren remained awake as she sat beside Megan holding
her hand.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Finally, after passing
twelve thousand steps, a different call came over the radio: “Search base, this
is team one.  I think I’ve found her.”  I recognized the husky voice of the
SWAT team leader as the one who’d just made that announcement.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Team one,
acknowledged.  Can you verify her description and condition?” answered another
voice.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It’s a little girl
wearing a bright orange shirt.  There’s a large hollow tree that was blown down
over here and the little girl has climbed up into it.”  The radio transmission
crackled and went silent for a few seconds.  “She’s not coming out, though.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Understood, team one. 
Is the little girl injured?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            At that, Megan’s wide eyes
jerked toward me, and I felt my stomach turn over with fear.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No...” came the SWAT
team leader’s voice.  The transmission paused for a few seconds.  Megan and I
looked back and forth to each other during the silence.  What was wrong?  Why
wasn’t Piper coming out of the tree?  Was she not able to for some reason? 
Maybe she was stuck in the tree somehow?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What’s going on?” Megan
asked.  I shook my head to say I didn’t know.  Marianna and Easton were both
waking up now that something seemed to be happening.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Team one, this is
search base.  Understand that the girl you’ve found is not injured.  What is
keeping her from coming out?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Another pause.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Base, this is team
one,” came a different voice I didn’t recognize.  “Our team leader has crawled
as far as he can into the hollow tree trunk and is now talking with the girl. 
She says she needs some type of password.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Marianna suddenly burst
out laughing, breaking some of the tension in the room.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan looked up at me,
relief in her eyes, and said, “I guess we need to give them the password.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Outside at the SWAT team
van serving as the Search Base, I asked them to let me go in to the Sacred
Grove to coax Piper out of the tree.  No luck.  Still too windy and dark they
said.  So I did the next best thing I could think of.  I told them I’d need to
text it to the team who had found her.  They gave me the number and I keyed in
the troublesome password that Easton would be paying for when we got home, then
sent it.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            After a couple minute’s
wait, during which time Megan and the other kids arrived at the SWAT team van,
the other voice from team one came back over the radio: “Ha ha ha, the password
worked!  We’ve got her...she’s fine. Heh heh heh!...We’re on our way back up
there...ha!”  He was laughing, much to the confusion of the Search Base team
members listening in, who hadn’t seen the password I’d sent.  They looked at me
in confusion.  I smiled and shrugged.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And then I closed my
eyes and said a quick prayer: <i>Thanks</i>.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Elder Rindlisbacher came
hobbling up with Brother Evans, the m&amp;m guy from the Grandin Building. 
“Here they are, Elder Evans.”  Then, Elder Rindlisbacher, having apparently
discharged his duty, made a deferential little bow to “Elder” Evans, turned and
left, muttering, “Troublemakers...” as he left.  I could only guess he meant
us.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You’re completely
soaked, Brother Evans,” Megan said to him.  And he was.  Head to toe.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Just a little,” he
said, smiling.  “I got another message that there was a problem here at the
Sacred Grove...again,” he said, looking from Megan to me, in obvious
recognition.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I remember now!  You’re
number 92!” exclaimed Marianna suddenly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What?” he asked, as all
of us turned to Marianna, confused at this sudden numerical outburst.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Number 92 in the line
of succession to the presidency of the Church,” she said brightly, the wind
still screeching behind her.  “Unless someone ahead of you died in the past two
weeks, that is.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “She means that 92
people have to kick it,” interpreted Lauren, “Before he becomes the prophet.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Leave it to my family to
greet a general authority like this.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            <i>Elder</i> Evans
looked slightly surprised, but recovered well, saying, “Yeah, so I guess I
really am a ‘nobody’ general authority, aren’t I?”  For a moment, I thought <i>I
</i>had made that comment to him, but relaxed when I remembered it had been his
own family.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Eventually, the SWAT
team leader arrived with Piper, whom everyone hugged tightly (Piper, that is,
not the SWAT team leader).  Piper explained that she’d taken a wrong turn onto
one of the paths and gotten lost.  She must have circled all the way back to
the section where all the oldest trees were.  She explained that there were
sticks and branches falling all around her and she was scared that something
would fall and hit her, so when she saw a big hollow tree trunk nearby, she hid
inside and was waiting for the storm to stop.  I turned to the SWAT team leader
and tried to apologize to him for the password situation.  I guessed that his
team would forevermore remind him that he had once said, “My underwear’s too
tight.”  He simply looked at me with a mix of contempt and disdain. 
Fortunately, Elder Evans took him by the elbow and walked him back toward the
welcome center.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Let’s go fill out a
report, shall we?” said Elder Evans, looking back and winking at me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Elder McGreg!” called
Higgs, Sr., emerging from the tree line of the Sacred Grove below the welcome
center.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Here,” I said to Lauren
quietly, handing her the keys.  “Take everyone to the van.  I’ll be there in a
minute.”  Lauren took the keys, handed me Higgs’ radio, and then took Megan by
the hand and headed into the parking lot toward our van.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs jogged up to me,
panting, and said, “We heard on the radio they found your daughter.  Is
everyone okay?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah.  Everyone is
fine.  Thanks for helping with the search, Higgs,” I said.  Sincerely.  And
then, in the heat of the moment, I reached out and gave Higgs a hug.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, good!  I’m so
glad,” he said, somewhat surprised.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Sorry.  Just happy
everyone’s okay,” I said, releasing him.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Look,” he said, “Since
last night and this afternoon have been so rotten for you, I’ve got a surprise
for you.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What’s that?” I asked. 
And with the emotional release of Piper being safe, I was surprised how quickly
my mind could switch back to normal and ask itself, “Could it be...a walk on
part in the pageant?”  I crossed my fingers.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I called over to the
hill and they’re going to let you park in Zion’s camp and set up some seats for
you near the front for the pageant tonight.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I rolled my eyes and
pointed at the sky.  “Higgs, do you honestly think the show will happen
tonight?  Look at the storm.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs smiled as if I
just didn’t understand.  “C’mon!  Have a little faith!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “We need to keep up with
him, Will,” said Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What do you mean?  One,
he drives too fast.  Two, we already know where we’re going.  And three, it’s
impossible to lose sight of him in that overly bright monstrosity, anyway,” I
said, pointing to the huge yellow Hummer already three cars ahead of us. 
Higgs, Sr. had arranged for us to follow him to his trailer in the Zion’s Camp
area.  We would park there rather than over with the rest of the pageant
watchers across the road in the large, grassy field which, tonight, would be a
muddy mess.  We were now in a slowly moving line of cars waiting to reach the
entrance to the Hill Cumorah visitor’s center.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Daddy, what about
Angel?” Piper called from the back.  “He’s still missing.  When will we find
him?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I don’t know, Piper.  I
think he’ll be okay for now.  We’ll try to find him later,” I answered, trying
to sound reassuring.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “But he’ll be hungry. 
What will he eat?” Piper asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Maybe squirrel,”
quipped Lauren.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Oh, he’s turning!”
called Megan, pointing at Higgs’ yellow Hummer (now five cars ahead of us)
making a left off the main road, annoyingly different from the hundreds of
other normal cars being directed to the right.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay, okay.  I see
him,” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As anticipated, it took
a few minutes of persuasion with the traffic director to get him to let us turn
left to follow Higgs, and it finally necessitated the mention of Dr. Higgins’
name and a little Assistant-to-Twelve impersonation on my part for the guy to
immediately move the traffic barrier for us.  We made our way to Higgs’
gigantic trailer (“It’s bigger than I remember” from one of the kids in the
back) and parked beside him.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            True to Higgs’
prediction earlier, the storm was moving out.  To the west, we could see orange
wispy clouds in the dimming light of the sun as it was setting.  The pavement
and grass were still wet, and a low-hanging mist swirled a few feet above the
ground.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Bro,” said Higgs as we
started to pile out of our van.  “Let’s head over now.  We’ve got about twenty
minutes till it starts, and I’ll need to go get into costume.  Like I said,
I’ll be Father Lehi this year, so I need to hurry to get ready.  I just want to
make sure that you guys don’t have any more trouble today.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Agreed,” I said
quietly.  “Thanks.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay kids,” said
Megan.  “Lauren, get the blankets.  Marianna, you’ve got the camera.  Easton,
get the jackets.  Piper, hold my hand and don’t let go.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We locked up the van and
followed Higgs through the trees toward the audience seats, passing the
Gadianton Bathrooms along the way.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Everyone, see where the
bathrooms are?” called Megan to the kids.  My head snapped in her direction. 
Had she been reading my mind as I was remembering the deal I’d made with
Gadianton the Great?  The kids grumbled their acknowledgments back to her.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As we approached the
audience area, Higgs, Sr. stopped and talked with one of the ushers for a few
seconds.  The usher said something into his radio and nodded back to Higgs.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “They’re getting some
seats set up for you all,” said Higgs, jogging back to us.  “I’m going to head
over to start getting ready, but Ed,” he said, pointing to the usher he’d just
talked with, who tipped his hat at us, “Ed will show you where to sit here in a
few minutes.  If you have any trouble, have Ed call me up on his radio.  Okay?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Thank you so much,
Higgs,” said Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Higgs headed up another
darkening path toward a small building labeled “Costumes” leaving us standing
with Ed waiting for something to happen.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hey, isn’t that the
Garr family?” asked Marianna, pointing to the family sitting in the center of
the front row.  And, it was.  It was the same family I’d seen early this
morning when I’d come to visit Higgs.  From the drenched look of them, they’d
waited there the whole day long, through the wind and rain, apparently intent
on getting the best seats in order to see Elder Tygart play the part of the
Savior.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wow,” I said.  “It
looks like they’ve been there all day long.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “They must really love
that missionary, to sit through all that today,” said Megan over my shoulder. 
“We should go say hi and ask how their trip has been so far.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We told the kids to stay
put with Ed, and told Ed we were just going to say hi to some people we knew,
and headed over to where the Garrs were sitting.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hi!  Sister Garr,
right?” I said as Megan and I approached them.  Sister Garr looked up at us and
immediately frowned, just like we’d seen her do in the store parking lot two
days prior.  This really didn’t make sense to me at all.  After all, we’d given
up our hotel room for them, hadn’t we?  “We met at the Palmyra Inn a few days
ago?”  Pause.  Sister Garr still held that stiff frown on her face.  “Where we
gave you our room?”  Still nothing.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “So,” interrupted Megan,
again doing her best to interrupt the awkwardness, “How has your stay been here
in Palmyra, anyway?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Sister Garr let her gaze
linger on me for a few extra seconds, then switched to Megan and opened her
mouth.  “Muddy.  It’s been muddy.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan and I glanced at
each other, each trying to silently ask the other if we knew what was going
on.  Why did the Garrs seem to be so upset with us?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You mean just today? 
Because of the rain?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, the whole week.  We
had to move over to the Possum Creek Camp Ground, and it’s been muddy the whole
week!” she said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Now that I looked
closer, not only were the Garrs’ clothes still wet from the rain today, but
their shoes and the bottoms of their pant legs were brown with mud.  Then I
remembered Easton commenting about the mud on their car when we’d passed them
in the store parking lot the other day, too.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I don’t understand. 
Why didn’t you stay in the room we gave up for you all?” asked Megan.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “We were going to, but
as soon as we opened that door and stepped in, we saw water pouring in from the
ceiling.  They had a water pipe---”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Burst...” I mumbled,
suddenly realizing what had happened.  Bob the maintenance guy at the hotel had
been working on the busted water pipe since we’d arrived.  That room must have
been where the break was.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Exactly!  So we ended
up having to go to that camp ground anyway,” said Sister Garr.  She took a deep
breath and finally looked away from us up the hill.  “At least we’ve got
front-row seats to see Elder Tygart tonight, though.  That’s what we really
came to see, after all.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            There was another
awkward pause.  I didn’t know what to say.  And apparently neither did Megan. 
Miraculously, a question came to me.  “Did Elder Tygart tell you how he will
make his entrance tonight in the pageant?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            At this, Sister Garr
finally smiled proudly and answered softly, “Yes, he did.  He’ll start at the
top, like he had just appeared in the sky like the Savior.  I can’t wait to see
him, all dressed in white, coming down toward us tonight!  That’s why we’ve
been waiting here all day long.  I didn’t want anything to be between us and
seeing him descend from up on high!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Just then, several young
men dressed in brightly colored Lamanite costumes started plopping chairs down
right in front of the Garrs next to where Megan and I were standing.  Ed the
usher came up along with the kids.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Here you go,” said Ed. 
“Front row seating for you all tonight!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            My mouth was hanging
open as I looked from Ed down to Sister Garr, whose eyes had just turned a
vivid color of “I hate you.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Needless to say, I
quickly caught the stripling warriors and asked them to move our chairs over to
the side, away from anyone who’d legitimately earned front-row rights.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Are we going to be able
to see?” asked Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “At this point, it
doesn’t matter.  We can <i>not</i> sit where they were putting those chairs,
right in front of the Garrs,” answered Megan for me.  “Not after the week
they’ve had.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The kids protested a
little, but when we explained what had happened, they wisely accepted our new
seating arrangement.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As we waited, Megan
maneuvered so that she could talk to me so that the kids wouldn’t hear, and
asked, “So, what’s bothering you tonight?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I started at the
question.  “Me?  What do you mean?  Just settling down from Piper being lost,”
I waffled.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I can tell you’re upset
about something.  What is it?” she asked again.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I sighed and told her
that I’d messed things up.  That Higgs had called two weeks ago offering us a
walk-on part in a crowd scene, and that I’d turned it down because I didn’t
want to accept his charity.  I told her how I’d made the deal with Gadianton
the Great (whose name made Megan giggle), and how that hadn’t worked out; and
how I’d finally gone back to Higgs and asked if he could get us in after all,
and how that hadn’t worked, either.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You did <i>that</i>?”
she asked, straightening up in her seat.  “You went back to Higgs and groveled
to get us into the pageant?  I can’t believe you’d do something like that.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I shrugged.  She nodded.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            A few minutes later, the
pageant got underway, and the kids discovered that we could, in fact, see what
was going on after all.  So they settled in under the blankets that we’d
brought.  Before we knew it, Higgs was out there being Father Lehi with his
family, prophesying doom and gloom in Jerusalem.  But I was having trouble
paying attention.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I really had so much
wanted to be able to surprise Megan and the kids by pulling them into the
costume department, donning some big, bright Book of Mormon garb, and getting
destroyed with them at the foot of the temple.  Ah, wouldn’t that have been
great?</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And then, on top of
that, there was the problem with the Garrs, which I hadn’t even suspected was
going on until just a few minutes ago.  I thought they were comfortably set up
in the hotel room we’d given them.  And all that time, while we had been living
in luxury (there, I admitted it, okay?), they had been slopping around in the
mud all week.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I got a sudden idea. 
And I knew I had to act on it.  The kids wouldn’t be happy, and we’d miss out
on seeing Carrie-Willow the next morning, but Megan would probably give me
points for it.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Megan,” I whispered to
Megan as Higgs started his vision of the Tree of Life.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What?” she asked, her
eyes still watching the depiction of the vision.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I...”  I was battling
in my head whether to tell her about the idea right then and there.  “...I
think I’m going to check with the hotel about something.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “About what?” she
asked.  “In the middle of the pageant?  Higgs is up on stage, now.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah, I know.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “But this is what we
came for.  Don’t you want to see the show?” she asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I smiled.  “I’ve seen
him, I mean...the show before.  Besides,” I said, getting up from my seat as
the lights dimmed for a change of scene.  “I know how this all ends up.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I hurried off to the tree
line flanking the audience seating area, toward the Gadianton Bathrooms we’d
passed on our way in, and pulled out my phone.  I dialed the number for the
hotel and waited for someone to answer.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hello.  You’ve reached
the Palmyra Inn.  How may I direct your call?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hi, is this Willow?” I
asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes,” she said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hi, this is Will
McCraig.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Dr. Higgins’ friend,”
she said simply.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah,” I said,
shrugging.  “That’s right.  Hey, I wondered if by some chance there were a room
open there tonight?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Um, no, not really,”
she answered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hmmm,” I said.  I
looked over toward where Megan and the kids were sitting.  I weighed some
options in my head.  If worse came to worse, we could simply start driving home
and stay somewhere else tonight.  “I wondered if, for tonight, I could put
another family into the room we’ve been staying?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You want to put someone
else into Dr. Higgins’ suite tonight?” she asked.  “Have you all checked out
already?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, not really,” I
said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Then where are you
planning to stay tonight?” she asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Honestly, I’m not
sure.  But we’ll figure something out,” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Let me guess: this is
for that family you originally gave up your first room for, isn’t it?” she
asked.  “I heard about that.  Is that it?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Um, yeah, it is.  So,
can we do that?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            She hesitated and then
said, “Well, here’s what I’ll do.  The room you were originally supposed to
have is supposed to be ready later tonight.  How about if I put them into that
one?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I looked back toward the
pageant.  It looked like we were up to where Lehi and his family were building
the ship.  I could see the Garrs watching in their wet, muddy clothes.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “How about this?” I
asked back.  “We’ll take that room and let this other family take the suite for
the night.  Is that okay?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Carrie-Willow agreed and
did some typing and then we hung up.  At least one of my failures for this trip
was now resolved.  I headed back to where Megan and the kids were and sat back
down with them.  I explained quickly to Megan what I’d done and she smiled her
approval at me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            After a little while,
Lehi and his family finally arrived in the Promised Land.  Higgs gave thanks at
an altar.  But as he did that, something small caught my eye on the far side of
the stage.  It was gray and white, and was walking around with its tail held
high in the air.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            It was our cat, Angel!</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And I wasn’t the only
one who had seen him.  I looked over at my family, all of whom were now looking
at me with wide eyes.  At the next scene change, I motioned for everyone to
huddle so we could figure out what to do.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Dad!  Did you see
Angel?” asked Piper.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes, I did,” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “How are we going to get
up there to catch him?” asked Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I lowered my eyes and
started thinking.  I was sure that if we didn’t take action now, we might lose
our chance.  Who knew if we’d ever see him again once the destruction scene,
with all the bedlam and chaos, took place.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Well,” I said.  “We
have to do something, now rather than later.  Any ideas?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan looked at me
mischievously, then turned to Lauren and asked, “Is that headdress you got at
the dance still in the van?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Lauren nodded that she
had, indeed, left her headdress from the dance the night before in the van. 
Megan directed us to grab our blankets and head out.  We waved at Ed the usher
as Megan led us toward Zion’s Camp.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Let’s do this,” said
Megan, smiling at me.  “Will, take this blanket and wrap it around your
shoulders.  Put on the headdress.  Piper, can we borrow your belt?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “My pants will fall
down,” said Piper.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Nevermind about the
belt, then,” said Megan.  “Where’s Angel’s leash?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Piper grabbed the leash
from under one of the seats in the van.  Megan tied it around my waist. 
Suddenly, I looked sort of like a cast member.  And since it was dark, maybe it
would work.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You,” she said,
pointing at Marianna, “Put this other blanket on.  Do we have any napkins or
anything?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “In the box!” said
Easton, kicking off toward the Higgins’ “box” (which <i>I </i>still say is
really a shed) where the Higginses kept all their extra culinary supplies. 
Easton came back with a couple of large, linen napkins along with some fancy
ribbon.  Megan used those to make shepherd hats for Marianna and Easton.  She
cut head-holes in the middle of another couple of our blankets and draped them
over Marianna and Easton, then tied them off at their waist like long doublets.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay, then,” I said,
marveling at Megan’s resourcefulness.  “Marianna, Easton, and I will make our
way on stage to look for Angel.  Megan, Lauren, and Piper will look around on
the sidewalks along the side.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Dad,” interrupted
Lauren, holding her phone to her ear.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What is it, Lauren?” I
asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hold on a second,” she
said.  “Hyrum is going to meet us.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Who is Hyrum?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You know...Higgs, Jr.?”
she answered.  “And, I’ve got this!” she said, holding up her honorary crowd
lanyard.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Lauren had pulled an ace
out of her sleeve.  We made our way back over toward the stage where, sure
enough, Higgs, Jr., dressed as a Nephite young man, was waiting for us by the
Gadianton Bathrooms.  The combination of him and Lauren’s lanyard got us past
the checkpoint and up the hill a little ways.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Do you know which level
you saw your cat on?” Hyrum asked once we’d made our way halfway up the hill.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It looked like about
halfway up, but we couldn’t tell for sure,” I said.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I have to go on stage
here in a minute and throw things at Samuel the Lamanite.  Try looking up and
down these paths that go along the side of the stage.  I’ll help once my scene
is over,” he said.  Then he waved and left us there.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We walked up and down,
trying to remain inconspicuous.  There was a lot of activity going on.  Cast
members and supporting crew were constantly moving back and forth, so we were
able to blend in to some extent.  I kept my eyes on the stage itself while
Megan and the kids tried calling out “Angel” every now and then while looking
into the bushes.  For as long as I’d ever known, I had yet to see Angel respond
to his name, so I wasn’t sure how much good that would do, but since it was the
only tool in our belt (or, in my case, cat leash) at that point, we had to use
it.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Finally, on our third
trip back down the hill, I looked over and felt my heart skip a beat---I’d
found him!  Angel was sitting on the edge of one of the platforms, right next
to a hidden stairway.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The lights went down
again between scenes.  I grabbed Marianna and Easton and whispered, “When the
lights come up, find a place to fit in.  Angel’s right over there.”  And then
we ducked down, ran onto the stage in the dark, hid behind a big <i>thing</i>,
and waited for the lights to come back up.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            While we waited, some
things started to come together in my mind.  If Higgsy had been headed out to
throw things at Samuel the Lamanite, that meant we were coming up on the
destruction scene.  And if the destruction scene were coming, whatever we were
hiding behind was probably going to fall.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Suddenly the lights came
up.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Samuel the Lamanite was
just climbing up onto the wall with wide, outstretched arms when I tugged on
Marianna’s and Easton’s sleeves.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “We’ve got to hurry! 
The world’s about to end!” I told them.  “Blend in with the crowd trying to
kill Samuel and look for Angel.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As the real cast crowd
moved past us, we separated and started following them.  I kept looking around,
under platforms, behind props, anywhere that looked like a place Angel might
hide, trying to find him there on the stage.  Not wanting to get too far from
Marianna and Easton, I checked around for them, too.  Marianna was several feet
behind me, smiling hugely, staring everywhere but where Angel might be:  at the
audience, at the lighting towers on either side of the staging area, and around
at other cast members.  Easton, similarly, had abandoned the search for Angel,
but was actually succeeding at blending in much better than Marianna.  When the
young men at the base of the wall started throwing things at Samuel the
Lamanite, Easton was all in.  He picked up whatever he could, and chucked it up
toward Samuel.  But while the real cast members were carefully aiming their
throws in order to avoid hitting Samuel, Easton was totally into his part, and
was aiming for the kill.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Easton!” I hissed.  He
looked back at me.  “Stop trying to kill Samuel and do what you’re supposed to
be doing!” I whispered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Finally, Samuel had had
enough, and he hopped down and ran away.  The time had come.  The destruction
scene was about to start, and we still hadn’t found Angel.  All around me,
Nephite civilization began to break down.  And then the earthquakes and storms
started.  The air filled with loud noises, screams, bright flashes of light,
red lava spouting into the air, buildings falling on people, people falling off
buildings, and Nephites dying all over the stage.  I looked over toward Easton,
and then back at Marianna.  They looked like they were asking what to do.  I
shrugged and fell down as dramatically as I could, hoping my death was a
convincing one.  I squinted down the hill and could see the Garrs in the front
row again.  Their moment was almost here.  Sister Garr’s glistening eyes were taking
in all the carnage, her hands clasped in nervous anticipation in front of her
chin.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And then total darkness
fell over the entire Hill Cumorah.  A voice proclaimed, “The Savior has died.” 
Somewhere down below us, I could hear someone with great spiritual sensitivity
sniffling into a tissue.  (I suspected it was Sister Garr.)</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Then there was silence
as deep as the darkness.  I looked up at the stars now visible in the night
sky.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            From the pageant
speakers, a gentle, deep voice spoke into the darkness, “Behold, my Beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name---hear ye
Him.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            An intensely bright,
white figure appeared to materialize in the sky above the Hill Cumorah.  I,
along with the entire cast, crew, and audience, gasped.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%;page-break-before:always'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><b><span id='Chapter-15'>15</span></b></p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            At this point in the
Book of Mormon story, the Savior was supposed to appear.  And, just as Samuel
had predicted a few moments ago, He had, in reality, appeared.  Dressed in
dazzlingly white robes, bathed in the light of numerous spotlights, He began
his descent.  I had witnessed this spectacle before on previous viewings and
had actually been looking forward to it.  It is a very dramatic scene.  And
from my experiences with Sister Garr thus far, I even knew that it was Elder
Tygart playing the part up there at the top of the Hill Cumorah.  I expected
all of this.  These parts had gone exactly as had been planned.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The part that hadn’t
been planned, I’m very sure, is that the figure of the Savior in the sky above
the Hill Cumorah tonight was struggling to hold a little girl in a bright,
orange shirt, who was, in turn, struggling to hold onto a gray and white cat,
all while descending toward the now-destroyed temple steps, where, somehow, I
had managed to die, along with Easton and Marianna.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Instinctively, I looked
around for Megan, who had evidently mugged a Nephite woman backstage and taken
her apparel, because she was creeping out onto the stage, along with Lauren,
who was also now properly arrayed in period attire, toward me, both of them
staring up into the heavens.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And I knew in my heart: 
Sister Garr will remember us for the rest of her life.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            It would take several
recitations of Piper’s memories of that night to piece together a timeline of
the events that brought her into the Savior’s arms.  From what we can tell,
here is what happened.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Lauren and Piper had
been searching the sidewalks along the side of the staging area for Angel. 
During the destruction scene, Higgs, Jr. ran off-stage to meet them.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Is your cat gray and
white?” Higgs, Jr. had asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes!” Piper had
answered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I think he’s up at the
top of the hill, wandering around the Moroni statue.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Now, in the intervening
years, we have since talked with Higgs, Jr., who ended up going on his own
mission, and fulfilling his destiny as a “chosen one” in the Higgins dynasty. 
In other words, he turned out to be an okay kid.  Probably good.  Most likely
excellent.  Anyway, he told us that, at this point, like most stories that
involve Piper, she took off much faster than he anticipated.  He said that he
couldn’t keep up with her because of all the people exiting the stage at that
point.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Piper evidently made it
to the top of the hill, near where the statue of the Angel Moroni stood, and
found Angel the cat.  To her delight, he was cowering on the steps behind the
statue just as the booming and flashing started at the beginning of the
destruction scene.  Piper tried to approach Angel, but Angel, being scared by
the mayhem on the hill below, darted out of her reach.  She followed him into the
bushes and caught him, but somehow, her larger-than-normal Super Big Mart belt
became wrapped around some kind of hook.  She tried to free herself, but was
suddenly lifted off the ground and blinded by spotlights.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And, at that particular
moment, from where I sat, Piper, Angel, and Elder Tygart slowly descended until
they all three landed on the temple steps, where I was miraculously resurrected
and joined Megan, Lauren, Marianna, and Easton in receiving Piper and Angel
from Elder Tygart’s arms, just as the Mormon Tabernacle Choir’s angelic
flourish rose to its climactic peak.  Piper then waved enthusiastically to the
crowd, much to their delight, and decided to ham it up a bit by waving Angel’s
paw at the crowd, too.  The lights went down, and after the announcer asked the
audience to bear with the production crew as they resolved the issue and reset
for a replay, I turned to Megan and said, “Well, how’s that for a vacation?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The Garrs, after a
single night in “the suite,” did frankly forgive us.  As much as I poo-poo-ed
the extravagance of the Higgins’ hotel room, it ended up that I really missed
it on that final night in the “grunt-grade” room.  Carrie-Willow had done us a
favor and had Bob set up a video-game system for the kids to ease our
transition back to plebeian life, so when the kids woke up, they all began
watching Lauren sail through level after level of whatever game they were all
interested in at the time.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            At a stopping point, I
interrupted the game.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hey, everyone,” I
said.  “Before we take off today, there’s something I want to do for Willow,
down at the front desk.  I checked the van earlier today for the Book of Mormon
I packed at the beginning of the trip, but I can’t find it.  Does anyone know
where it went?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Why?  You want to hit
her with a Book of Mormon?” asked Easton.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I think he wants to
give it to her,” said Marianna.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            No one seemed to know
where it had gone.  Just as I was about to give up hope, Lauren put the video
game controller down, stood up, and walked over to the book she’d been reading
all week sitting on the table.  She picked it up, took the vampire book jacket
off the outside and walked over to me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Here,” she said.  “I
finished it.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            As I said, she’d been
reading it all week.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan gave me a “Who’da thunk?”
look.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            We all wrote a little
thank-you message to Carrie-Willow on the inside front cover.  And then, after
packing and hauling everything out to our van, we all went back into the lobby
of the hotel and approached the desk where blue-haired Carrie-Willow was again
reading.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Are you okay?” Megan
whispered to me.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I exhaled and looked up
and over at her and said, “Yeah” with a tentative smile.  “I think so.”  This
was actually my first time doing this since my mission.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hello, Carrie,” I said
when we arrived at the counter.  She looked up from her book and, seeing the
whole family, smiled at us.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hello!  How was the
room last night?” she asked.  “Probably not quite as big as what you were used
to, huh?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It was wonderful,” said
Megan.  The kids politely nodded in agreement.  “Thank you so much for helping
us out last night.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “It was my pleasure,”
said Carrie-Willow, smiling.  “You all ready to check out, now?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yeah,” I said, handing
the key cards to her.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay, then, looks like
you’re all set,” she said, tapping some keys on her keyboard and depositing the
cards into a slot behind the counter.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “We’d also like to give
you something else,” I said.  I took out the Book of Mormon we’d all just
finished writing in and laid it on the counter in front of her.  She looked at
it with a funny look on her face and then looked up at me as if she were
puzzled.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I explained that it was
the Book of Mormon, and what it meant to us as a family.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “We wanted to give it to
you, because I’ve been watching you this week, and you seem like a truly...good
person,” I said.  “The things in this book have really made us happy as a
family, and we just wanted to share it with you.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            She still had a puzzled
look on her face, like she wanted to tell us something, but couldn’t quite
figure out how to say it.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What?  Has someone
already given you one of these?” I asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            She nodded and smiled. 
“Well, yeah...of course,” she said.  Then turned to the title page of the book
she’d been reading and turned it around for us to see, “The Book of Mormon.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='text-indent:35.45pt;line-height:200%'>“Oh,” she
blurted.  “I forgot to tell you; some kid named Jared has been calling.  He
says there’s something wrong with your cat because he hasn’t seen it lately and
none of the food has been eaten.  I didn’t think he was for real because you
have your cat with you, right?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Megan and I both rolled
our eyes in unison.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            And that’s when Higgs,
Sr. squealed into the parking lot in front of the lobby.  All our heads jerked
in that direction.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I rolled my eyes. 
“Really?  Now?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Elder McGreg!” he
called as he bounded out of the yellow Hummer and ran toward us.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Higgs?  What’s up?” I
asked as he came to a stop in front of us.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hi, Megan,” he said
quickly, then turned to me.  “Bro, I just got off the phone.  You’ll never
believe what kind of opportunity I’ve just been offered for next summer!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Free teeth whiten---?”
said Lauren, before Megan quickly covered her mouth.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Dude, I know I should have
called or come over and asked you first, but I couldn’t help myself.  I had to
give an answer right then and there.  So I went ahead and put your names in
already because you have to come with us next summer.  It’s going to be another
awesome summer!  Guess where!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “You got me.  Where?” I
winced, wrinkling my left eye, sort of in the same way I’d do if a tooth were
being extracted.  Without anesthesia.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Kirtland!”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “This is the
two-hundredth semi-annual General Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints...” said the announcer’s voice over the ceiling speakers from
within our ward’s chapel.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hurry up!  It’s
starting!” I called to the thunder of running feet coming up the sidewalk
behind me.  I was holding the outside door open and counting kids.  I ran out
of fingers.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “This special session of
conference is being broadcast from the Peter Whitmer Log Home in Fayette, New
York.  Attendees include the First Presidency, members of the Quorum of the
Twelve, along with other General Authorities.  Joining them are descendants of
early prominent members of the Church from the Fayette area.”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Just made it, didn’t
we?” Megan asked, sliding into the pew ahead of me.  The bishop looked over at
us and smiled patiently as our noisy crowd gathered into the center section of
pews.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Shhh,” shushed Lauren
to her four sons.  They immediately complied.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Okay, everyone get
their conference scavenger sheets out,” Marianna whispered to three little
girls dressed in airy pink dresses, each with a different pair of loud colored
shoes.  All three pulled out pastel-colored spiral notebooks with feathery pens
and pencils.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hey, Dad.  You made it!”
whispered Easton, waving with his elbow, trying to keep a sleeping baby level.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Here, Piper.  You guys
sit here on this side,” suggested Megan, patting the spot on the pew to her
left for Piper and her new husband to sit.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Brothers and Sisters,”
the prophet greeted from behind a rough-hewn wooden lectern perched on what I
recognized as the table in the front room of the Whitmer’s log home.  “We
extend to you a warm greeting from here within the log home on the grounds of
the Peter Whitmer Farm in historic Fayette, New York.  This sacred edifice,
with its humble dimensions...”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Bampa?” said one of
Marianna’s little girls, her head peeking over the top of the pew’s seat-back
in front of us.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Yes?” I whispered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Mommy says you bumped
your head in that house,” she said, pointing a little finger toward the
projected image of the prophet.  “Does it still hurt?”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, it’s all better
now,” I smiled back.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Is that why you don’t
have any hair left?” she asked.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “No, ask your Mom where
it all went,” I answered.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “...Following the
opening prayer, the assembled choir will favor us with a song, followed by our
first speaker...”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Following several late,
high-pitched “Amens” from our grandchildren scattered all around us, we all
listened as the small choir sang.  The first speaker outlined the basic
chronology of events which took place at the Whitmer farm.  I remembered much
of it, including the cow, from Elder and Sister Rindlisbachers’ presentation
all those years ago.  I nudged Megan to my left.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “What?” she answered
quietly.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Wouldn’t it be funny if
we were called on a mission to give tours there?” I teased.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            She smiled and then we
went back to watching our kids’ kids watching conference, some swinging their
feet, and at least one sleeping.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Brothers and Sisters,
we shall now be pleased to welcome Brother and Sister Willard and Beulah
Rindlisbacher---“</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Huh?” all four of our
kids, Megan and I said in unison.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “---to help us open the
time capsule created during the one hundred fiftieth celebration...”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “I wonder why they
didn’t just use the word ‘sesquicentennial’,” Piper wondered out loud.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The video feed
immediately switched to the grassy area in front of the log home, where a small
group of people were gathered around a pedestal topped with a bronze sculpture
depicting the restoration of the priesthood to Joseph Smith and Oliver
Cowdery.  On either side of the pedestal was a cloth-covered table and a simple
lectern with a microphone.  Seated in the center behind the pedestal was an ancient-looking
couple: the Rindlisbachers, still dressed as they were the last time we’d seen
them.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            A somewhat younger
general authority got up to speak at the lectern.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “Hey, isn’t that the
m&amp;m guy?” asked Marianna.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            It was, indeed, Elder
Evans, the one-time “nobody” general authority Easton had saved at the E. B.
Grandin building by administering the Heimlich maneuver.  Elder Evans explained
that following the conclusion of the sesquicentennial celebration of the Church
in 1980, this time capsule had been assembled and placed in the Whitmer Farm
visitor’s center.  It was scheduled to be opened fifty years later, and that
due to the fact that the Rindlisbachers had spent so many years as a missionary
couple in the Palmyra area, that the privilege to open the capsule was being
extended to them.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Elder Rindlisbacher was
assisted up to the pedestal, where two white-gloved technicians removed the
bronze sculpture from the top and carried it off-camera.  Another pair of
white-gloved technician assistants appeared behind the table on the other side
of the pedestal.  The one nearest the pedestal reached in and began handing
things over to the other technician, who held it up to the camera while Elder
Rindlisbacher read what the object was.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “This is a photograph of
President Spencer W. Kimball along with other attendees at the dedication of
the Whitmer Farm on April 6<sup>th</sup>, 1980,” he read.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            One by one, the
technicians removed other items from the time capsule within the pedestal,
including a program from the meetings of that day, transcripts of the talks
given, a ticket to attend the dedication session, and some other odds and
ends.  Finally, near the bottom, there was one last item left.  The technicians
had been checking the items off their list.  There was some excited whispering
back and forth between them.  The background noise volume increased as the
audio of their whispering was amplified enough to hear bits and pieces of the
conversation.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “...don’t see anything
more on the list, do you?  ...suppose...omitted by accident?” we heard the
technicians discussing.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “...could be an exciting
new discovery!” said another technician’s voice.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Just then, Megan nudged
me and indicated that I should look toward Piper.  Piper had her hand over her
mouth, her eyes wide, and face white as a proverbial sheet.  She looked over
toward her brother Easton, who was now standing absolutely still, his mouth
also wide open.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            Finally, the pedestal
technician reached in and grabbed the last item.  It was a small, ticket-sized
piece of paper with a hole punched in one corner.  Some faded color was
visible, but the writing was too small to read, as it hadn’t been held up to
the camera, yet.</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            The item was laid
carefully on the cloth-covered table and immediately photographed, then turned
over and photographed again.  More whispered discussions were taking place, and
then the item was lifted up to Elder Rindlisbacher to read.  He adjusted his
reading glasses, moved his head to the proper distance from this exciting last
item in order to see it properly, and began reading:</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “This appears to be a
‘Buy Twelve Get One Free for the Prophet’ card, good for one free ice cream
cone following the purchase of twelve other ice cream cones.  And on the back,
there is a handwritten note which reads...”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            At this point, an
overhead camera angle zoomed in on the card where we read along with Elder
Rindlisbacher:</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “‘Dear Church President
guy,</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            “‘I have to write fast
because me, dad and Angel are going to go get more plates from a box at the
Hill Cumorah. I wanted to give this coupon to you because you are a nice man
and ice cream is good.  Thank you for being the prophet and telling everyone to
choose the right.  Your friend, Piper.’”</p>

<p class=Standard style='line-height:200%'>            I pointed with satisfaction
at my chest and said, “Yep, that was us!”</p>
